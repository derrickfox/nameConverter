Standard treatments consist of non-specific chemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplantation, which are frequently associated with significant side effects, including life-threatening infections, bleeding, kidney dysfunction and even death. This project seeks to develop a drug targeted to the specific causal genetic abnormality responsible for CBF leukemia, with the aim of significant improvement in survival and reduced complications compared with current treatments.","Summary":"Leukemia is a bone marrow cancer involving developing white blood cells and often is associated with specific, recurrent chromosome translocations and inversions that generate fusion genes, which play critical roles in leukemogenesis.\n\nIn this project, targeted treatments are being developed for a subgroup of leukemia based on current understanding of how leukemia develops at the molecular level. The core binding factor (CBF) subgroup of leukemia contains CBF fusion genes that have been shown to play critical roles in leukemia development. Current treatments for CBF leukemia are not optimal, with long-term survival at 50 percent. The research team conducted a small chemical library screen to find inhibitors that block CBF protein interactions. Through biochemical, cell culture and animal model studies, they identified three chemically related lead compounds. In particular, one of the three compounds has shown leukemia reduction capability similar to standard chemotherapy drugs in preliminary studies in a mouse CBF leukemia model. The researchers will complete efficacy studies in this mouse model, develop one or more backup compounds, optimize formulation, and perform pharmacokinetics and toxicology tests that will lead to clinical trials. \n\nTRND researchers have successfully optimized and demonstrated the utility of the animal disease model. TRND scientists have performed medicinal chemistry optimization to identify a compound with significantly improved pharmacokinetics and tolerability after repeat dosing in mice. In addition, the collaborator developed an improved in vitro efficacy assay, using cells extracted from bone marrow. This assay was used to conduct an in vitro efficacy profile with the optimized compound, with subsequent evaluation in the animal disease model planned. TRND will conduct the necessary studies to support filing an Investigational New Drug application with the Food and Drug Administration. \n"},{"Report Title":"LUM-001 as a Treatment for Creatine Transporter Deficiency","NIH Project ID":"","ZIA ID Number":"TR000006-04","NCATS Division":"","2018 Project Status ":"Active","2019 Project Status ":"","Lead Investigators":["A., Elizabeth"],"Supervisor of Record":["Simeonov, Anton"],"NCATS Team Members":["R, Asaf","M, Haksong","Sun, Wei","S, Pramod","Christina, London","Qiu, Amy","Xu, Xin","Zheng, Wei"],"Intramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":["Bianconi, Simona","D, Forbes"],"Extramural Collaborators (Affiliation)":"Chris Bemben Lumos Pharma, Inc.\nAleksandra Bruchey Lumos Pharma, Inc.\nRobert Davis Lumos Pharma, Inc.\nMinh-Ha Do Lumos Pharma, Inc.\nRichard Hawkins Lumos Pharma, Inc.\nDavid Weiner Lumos Pharma, Inc.\n","Does project use human cells, human subjects or human tissues?":"Human subject research\nHuman subject research: Minors\n","Keywords":"Orphan Drug; Drug Development; Neurosciences; Brain Disorders; Rare Diseases; Creatine Transporter Deficiency","Distinguishing Keyword":"","Goals and Objectives":"Creatine serves as a crucial energy source in the brain, and it is delivered to brain tissue by a specialized transport protein. An estimated 42,000 males in the United States are affected by creatine transporter deficiency (CTD), in which creatine cannot enter the brain, resulting in profound learning disabilities, autistic behavior, recurring epileptic seizures and lifelong care needs. There are no FDA-approved therapies for this group of patients. The lead collaborator has identified a creatine analog (LUM-001) that is able to penetrate the brain and serve the same role as creatine, even when creatine transporters are defective.

The primary clinical manifestations of the affected males are mental retardation, severe expressive language disorder and a seizure disorder, requiring dependent care for life. Creatine transporter knockout mice were treated with LUM-001, a repurposed small molecule that was shown to be capable of (1) getting across the blood-brain barrier and (2) improving brain metabolism and cognitive function of the mice. LUM-001, which has an inactive Investigational New Drug (IND) application filed for another indication, was shown to be effective in treating and reversing CTD in the knockout mouse model.\n\nTwo parallel groups of patients with brain creatine deficiency syndromes (GAMT and AGAT), which have similar clinical manifestations as CTD, show significant clinical improvement when supplemented with creatine monohydrate. Creatine monohydrate supplementation is not effective in CTD because the creatine transporter gene is defective, preventing creatine from crossing the blood-brain barrier. As a result, no clinical improvement has been measured in CTD patients when supplemented with creatine monohydrate. LUM-001 has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier, interact with creatine kinase in the brain, become phosphorylated and act in the same way as creatine as an energy source. The focus of this TRND collaboration is the manufacture of necessary active pharmaceutical ingredient (API); completion of a new Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control (CMC) section; and completion of all pre-clinical and IND-enabling studies. \n\nAfter TRNDs acceptance of the project, Lumos was able to secure additional funding from the Wellcome Trust and venture capital firms to speed the teams collaborative work. TRND scientists performed pharmacokinetic/distribution studies in animal models of the disease to better understand brain uptake of LUM-001.
