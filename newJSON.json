    "Summary": "Leukemia is a bone marrow cancer involving developing white blood cells and often is associated with specific, recurrent chromosome translocations and inversions that generate fusion genes, which play critical roles in leukemogenesis.In this project, targeted treatments are being developed for a subgroup of leukemia based on current understanding of how leukemia develops at the molecular level. The core binding factor (CBF) subgroup of leukemia contains CBF fusion genes that have been shown to play critical roles in leukemia development. Current treatments for CBF leukemia are not optimal, with long-term survival at 50 percent. The research team conducted a small chemical library screen to find inhibitors that block CBF protein interactions. Through biochemical, cell culture and animal model studies, they identified three chemically related lead compounds. In particular, one of the three compounds has shown leukemia reduction capability similar to standard chemotherapy drugs in preliminary studies in a mouse CBF leukemia model. The researchers will complete efficacy studies in this mouse model, develop one or more backup compounds, optimize formulation, and perform pharmacokinetics and toxicology tests that will lead to clinical trials. TRND researchers have successfully optimized and demonstrated the utility of the animal disease model. TRND scientists have performed medicinal chemistry optimization to identify a compound with significantly improved pharmacokinetics and tolerability after repeat dosing in mice. In addition, the collaborator developed an improved in vitro efficacy assay, using cells extracted from bone marrow. This assay was used to conduct an in vitro efficacy profile with the optimized compound, with subsequent evaluation in the animal disease model planned. TRND will conduct the necessary studies to support filing an Investigational New Drug application with the Food and Drug Administration.",

    "Goals and Objectives": "Creatine serves as a crucial energy source in the brain, and it is delivered to brain tissue by a specialized transport protein. An estimated 42,000 males in the United States are affected by creatine transporter deficiency (CTD), in which creatine cannot enter the brain, resulting in profound learning disabilities, autistic behavior, recurring epileptic seizures and lifelong care needs. There are no FDA-approved therapies for this group of patients.

    "Summary": "It is estimated that creatine transporter deficiency (CTD) causes between 1 and 5 percent of all X-linked mental retardation. The primary clinical manifestations of the affected males are mental retardation, severe expressive language disorder and a seizure disorder, requiring dependent care for life. Creatine transporter knockout mice were treated with LUM-001, a repurposed small molecule that was shown to be capable of (1) getting across the blood-brain barrier and (2) improving brain metabolism and cognitive function of the mice. LUM-001, which has an inactive Investigational New Drug (IND) application filed for another indication, was shown to be effective in treating and reversing CTD in the knockout mouse model.Two parallel groups of patients with brain creatine deficiency syndromes (GAMT and AGAT), which have similar clinical manifestations as CTD, show significant clinical improvement when supplemented with creatine monohydrate. Creatine monohydrate supplementation is not effective in CTD because the creatine transporter gene is defective, preventing creatine from crossing the blood-brain barrier. As a result, no clinical improvement has been measured in CTD patients when supplemented with creatine monohydrate. LUM-001 has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier, interact with creatine kinase in the brain, become phosphorylated and act in the same way as creatine as an energy source. The focus of this TRND collaboration is the manufacture of necessary active pharmaceutical ingredient (API); completion of a new Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control (CMC) section; and completion of all pre-clinical and IND-enabling studies. After TRNDs acceptance of the project, Lumos was able to secure additional funding from the Wellcome Trust and venture capital firms to speed the teams collaborative work. TRND scientists performed pharmacokinetic/distribution studies in animal models of the disease to better understand brain uptake of LUM-001. An in vitro disease model was developed - using patient skin cells to make Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (IPSCs) that were differentiated into neuronal cells - to study LUM-001 uptake and effect on metabolism. Toxicology studies, formulation development, and chemistry and manufacturing were completed to support an IND application and initiation of a Phase 1 clinical safety study in healthy volunteers. To support future clinical trials of LUM-001, TRND is collaborating with Lumos on a prospective natural history study of the disease course in patients at multiple sites, including the NIH Clinical Center, which was initiated in 2017 and is currently on-going.",

    "Summary": "Heterotopic ossification (HO), the formation of ectopic bone in skeletal muscle and other connective tissues, is an important cause of morbidity from joint immobility and pain. Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP), a rare form of HO, is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and is typically associated with activating mutations in Acvr1, the gene encoding the BMP type I receptor, ALK2. Individuals with FOP only have minimal skeletal abnormalities at birth, but extensive HO affecting nearly all skeletal muscles, ligaments and fascia is triggered after birth by traumatic injury or inflammation. No effective treatments currently exist for FOP patients, and disease progression results in severe restriction of joint function and premature mortality.In 2008, the principal collaborators identified the first small molecule inhibitor of BMP signaling. The compound, dorsomorphin, blocks BMP signaling by inhibiting BMP type I receptors. Dorsomorphin derivatives were developed through initial medicinal chemistry optimization. The overall objective of this research is to advance the development of a dorsomorphin derivative in preparation for clinical testing in patients with FOP. The TRND researchers determined that the initial lead molecule was unsuitable for further preclinical development. As such, TRND scientists performed medicinal chemistry optimization, synthesizing and evaluating with the collaborator over 1000 compounds in vitro. This led to the identification of a compound suitable for formal preclinical development, as well as an additional compound as a back-up. Activities in the lead optimization and development candidate selection included measuring compound efficacy against BMP signaling, assessing specificity and drug-like properties in vitro, and evaluating efficacy and tolerability in vivo.",

    "Summary": "The oxygen-carrying hemoglobin protein (Hemoglobin A or HbA) is a tetrameric molecule, comprising two paired alpha-chain/beta-chain protein dimers. Beta-thalassemia is caused by mutations that result in insufficient production of the beta-globin protein, whereas sickle cell disease is caused by a point mutation in the beta-globin protein that causes the hemoglobin tetramers to form rigid polymers that deform the red blood cell, causing early cell death, abnormal adhesion to blood vessels and resulting widespread organ damage.HbA is the adult form of hemoglobin, produced mostly after birth. At earlier developmental stages, fetal forms of hemoglobin (HbF) are expressed. Importantly, these fetal globin proteins can replace the abnormal adult beta-globin proteins found in sickle cell disease and compensate for the absence of adult beta-globin proteins in beta-thalassemia. Although fetal globin expression stops shortly after birth, the drug PB-04 can reactivate expression of the fetal-stage beta-globin gene. This activation may lead to production of sufficient levels of HbF to mitigate the beta-hemoglobinopathies. The goal of this project is to repurpose this drug, currently in use in the European Union and Canada for another indication, for treatment of the hemoglobin disorders beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease.The TRND team formalized and initiated a comprehensive preclinical project plan with a primary focus on beta-thalassemia as the first indication. The team has completed pharmacology and efficacy studies to recapitulate key data generated by the collaborator. The team received recommendations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the proposed studies required to support the filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application via pre-IND interactions. Pharmacokinetic, bioanalytical, and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) studies are nearing completion. IND-enabling toxicology studies have been completed. Formulation and manufacturing of the drug product is ongoing. These data and materials will enable the collaborator to file an IND application with the FDA.",

    "Summary": "The primary symptoms of hypoparathyroidism include muscle cramping, convulsions, intellectual disabilities, cataracts and abnormal heart rhythm. Symptoms are due to low serum calcium (hypocalcemia). Replacement of parathyroid hormone (PTH) has been explored to remedy the calcium deficiency, but maintaining an optimal calcium level has proven problematic because hypercalcemia can occur as a result of excess PTH. Multiple efforts are under way targeting either full-length PTH (PTH 184) or the active amino-terminal domain (PTH 134), but these molecules have undesirable pharmacokinetic properties for chronic daily management of calcium levels in patients with hypoparathyroidism.Eli Lilly scientists have identified a long acting PTH receptor modulator (PTH-RM) that can normalize serum calcium. At fairly low doses, the PTH-RM was shown to normalize calcium levels in parathyroidectomized rats. The investigators are collaborating with TRND to develop this PTH-RM toward a Phase II proof-of-concept study for hypoparathyroidism by leveraging the existing data package.TRND scientists, in collaboration with researchers from Eli Lilly & Company, have further developed and validated the rat thyroidectomy model of hypoparathyroidism to generate robust efficacy data. Analytical and sensitive bioanalytical methods have been developed and validated, and TRND scientists have manufactured 25g of the active pharmaceutical ingredient under Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) guidelines. If all preclinical milestones are achieved, TRND plans to support the preparation and filing of the Investigational New Drug application with the FDA, as well as partnering with NIH clinical experts to support subsequent clinical trials in patients.",

    "Summary": "Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines (NSML), previously referred to as LEOPARD Syndrome (LS), derived its name from its presenting manifestations: multiple lentigines (L), electrocardiographic conduction abnormalities (E), ocular hypertelorism (O), pulmonic stenosis (P), abnormal genitalia (A), retardation of growth (R) and sensorineural deafness (D). Despite the fact that pulmonic stenosis is part of the LS acronym, the most common cardiac manifestation is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which occurs in approximately 70 percent of NSML patients. To determine the biological and functional mechanisms in NSML, the lead collaborators generated an NSML mouse model harboring one of the two most common mutations in the human disease, the Y279C mutation in the PTPN11 gene. These mice recapitulated nearly all major aspects of the human NSML disorder. The investigators identified a hyperactivation of the Akt/mTor signaling pathway as the mechanism by which Y279C causes HCM in NSML, implicating rapamycin as a potential pharmacologic intervention.NSML is one of several autosomal dominant disorders associated with RAS/MAPK pathway genes (RASopathies). Rapamycin already is approved for treatment of renal cancer and is undergoing clinical trials for polycystic kidney disease. The goal of this project is to leverage TRND support to develop the necessary pre-clinical package to support filing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and clinical trials for HCM in NSML patients.The efforts in this project have focused on further characterization of the NSML mouse models using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure overall changes in heart structure and function, in comparison to echocardiography, to better inform clinical endpoints. TRND researchers are conducting additional animal efficacy studies with the lead molecule and another mTOR inhibitor. The results of these studies, in addition to known toxicology and other supporting information, will determine whether the data will enable filing an IND with the FDA to enter human trials for this indication.",

    "Summary": "Even while on current therapies, malaria patients remain infectious for a period of time, allowing further mosquito-borne transmission to others. Control of parasite transmission is critical for elimination and eradication of malaria. However, most antimalarial drugs are not active against sexual stage P. falciparum parasites called gametocytes which are responsible for the spread of malaria from person to person via mosquitoes. To begin to fill this void, investigators screened 5,215 known bioactive compounds and approved drugs for gametocytocidal activity. One compound with favorable pharmacokinetics, Torin2, was selected as the first candidate for further evaluation, including testing in an in vivo rodent malaria transmission model. Two 4 mg/kg doses completely blocked parasites ability to infect mosquitoes, and a 2 mg/kg dose gave a partial blockade, confirming the transmission-blocking activity of Torin2.Preliminary data indicate that the Torin2 target in P. falciparum is distinct from the mammalian target, which means researchers can design malaria-specific derivatives. Investigators used a gametocyte viability assay, a cellular mTOR assay and an in vivo rodent malaria transmission model to identify new malaria-specific Torin2 analogues. The goal of this project is to further optimize the Torin2 series and advance a drug candidate through preclinical development and early clinical development.Pilot studies between the lead collaborator and NCATS scientists resulted in identification of a series of compounds suitable for lead optimization. The TRND team initiated a comprehensive preclinical project plan, performing medicinal chemistry optimization to identify a lead candidate for further development. Initial pharmacology and ADME studies are being performed, with further studies planned to support filing an Investigational New Drug application with the Food and Drug Administration.",

    "Report Title": "Drug Repurposing Screening for Rare and Neglected Diseases",
    "Goals and Objectives": "There are approximately 7,000 rare and neglected diseases that currently lack effective treatments. Conventional drug discovery takes an average 12 years and costs hundreds of million dollars to develop each new drug. Due to the high cost, rare and neglected diseases are largely ignored by the pharmaceutical industry. Repositioning of approved drugs is a new direction for rapid identification of new therapeutics for rare and neglected disease. We have established a library of 2800 approved drugs and 2000 compounds that have been approved for clinical human trials. These compounds have accumulated preclinical and clinical data that could aid the process of drug development. Our goal is to rapidly identify new therapeutics for rare and neglected diseases through drug repurposing screens. We are applying new technologies and approaches for screening, such as, phenotypic cell-based disease models with patient-derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and high content screening platforms. Our approach is to work in collaboration with leading investigators at NIH, other academic institutes/universities, and companies. Our objectives include (1) identification of drug targets or disease phenotypes for assay development; (2) assay development and optimization for high-throughput screening; (3) drug repurposing screening to identify active compounds that reduce disease phenotypes; (4) confirmation of compound activity in in vitro assays and animal models; and (5) advancement of the newly identified compounds to clinical trials for the treatment of rare and neglected diseases.",

    "Summary": "In collaboration with NIH and academic researchers, we have performed drug repurposing screens for multiple projects across a range of therapeutic areas, including rare genetic disorders, bacterial and viral infectious diseases, and drug resistant cancer cells. DRUG RESISTANT CANCER: Cancer drug resistance is a severe clinical problem that often results in patient death. We performed drug repurposing screens for drug-resistant cell lines of ovarian cancer refractory to multiple standard care chemotherapies. Several approved drugs have been identified that either suppress the drug-resistant cancer cells directly or re-sensitize the resistant cells to the anticancer activities of the standard drugs. We also found that diverse mechanisms are involved in the drug resistance of ovarian cancer, indicating the importance of personalized treatment which can be obtained from personalized drug screens using patient-derived cancer samples.Using the cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell line (IGROV1 CR), we identified LY2784544, a JAK2 inhibitor that overcomes cisplatin resistance in these cells. Further study found that the elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in these drug resistant cells increases IL-11 expression and further activates JAK2STAT5 signal transduction pathway to endow the ovarian cancer cells with cisplatin resistance. Thus, LY2784544 could be applied with cisplatin to treat patients with this ROS-IL-11-JAK2 mediated drug resistance (Zhou et al, Oncogene 2018). Another repurposing screen using the cisplatin-resistant SKOV3 CR ovarian cancer cell line identified Chk1 inhibitors that re-sensitize cells to cisplatins apoptotic effects. Subsequent analyses using the identified Chk1 inhibitors found that elevated DUOXA1 increases ROS levels and activates the ATR-Chk1 pathway to cause the cisplatin resistance (Meng et al., Cancer Letter 2018). In the third drug repurposing screen using another multidrug resistant ovarian cancer cell line (A2780-cis), several compounds have been identified that restore cisplatin's apoptotic effect. One of the mechanisms for one group of active compounds involves reducing the elevated EGFR level in these cells. In addition to the compounds having synergistic effects with cisplatin, several other compounds have been found that suppress the drug-resistant cancer cells directly (Sima et al., Translational Oncology 2018). These compound can be further studied for potential clinical applications. We also performed repurposing screens against liver cancer and other gynecologic cancers, including cervical and placental. A number of active compounds were identified, and we are currently in the process of hit confirmation and follow-up experiments.LYSOSOMAL STORAGE DISEASE: We have performed drug repurposing screens using patient-derived fibroblasts for Niemann-Pick disease type A with a new high throughput instrument, the Mirrorball fluorescent cytometer, to identify compounds that reduced sphingomyelin accumulation in the patient cells. A set of 19 primary hits was found. Of these hits, 10 were confirmed to have relatively potent activities. We also carried out repurposing screens for Niemann Pick disease type C and Mucopolysaccharidosis type I using neural stem cells derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from patients. The primary hits are in the process of being validated and confirmed using secondary assays and biochemical methods. DRUG RESISTANT BACTERIA: Infections with multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms have emerged as a significant worldwide public health crisis. The incidence is increasing, partially due to the selective pressure from widespread use of antibiotics in both humans and animals. We have performed high throughput screening to identify individual drugs as well as synergistic drug combinations active against drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii, both isolated from patients. Several synergistic drug combinations have been identified and confirmed. These are currently being tested in animal models by our collaborators.",

    "Report Title": "Studies of Tumor-Penetrating Microparticles for Pancreatic Cancer",
    "Goals and Objectives": "Pharmaceutical companies generally focus on oncology drugs given by intravenous (IV) or oral administration. However, systemic therapy often does not deliver sufficient drug levels to solid tumors due to inadequate blood perfusion and high interstitial fluid pressure in tumors. On the other hand, intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy has demonstrated impressive survival advantage in multiple randomized trials. Due to the lack of approved IP products, these earlier studies used IV formulations. This approach has two limitations: (a) the restricted drug penetration to the tumor periphery diminishes the efficacy of IP treatment in patients with larger tumors, and (b) IP therapy is associated with infection due to indwelling catheter and with toxicity from high local drug levels, which produces abdominal pain. These problems have prevented widespread use of IP therapy in spite of the demonstrated efficacy. Our aim is to overcome these limitations and to address the unmet need of products suitable for IP treatments. The goal of this project is to develop an effective treatment for locoregional control of metastatic pancreatic cancer and, more generally, peritoneal tumors, which affect 230,000 new patients annually in the United States. The investigators have developed tumor-penetrating microparticles (TPMs), a first-in-class delivery system tailored to the unique anatomical properties of the peritoneal cavity. TPMs are multicomponent, multifunctional, biocompatible, biodegradable, controlled-release polymeric micron-size particles. TPMs are designed to target, penetrate and deliver pharmacodynamically optimized drug levels to the superficial and deep layers of peritoneal tumors. TPMs represent a delivery platform that can be used to deliver small molecule therapeutics, biologics, gene vectors and imaging agents. The first generation TPM, TPM001, is loaded with paclitaxel. The first indication for TPM001 is pancreatic cancer, which has a five-year survival rate of less than 5 percent.",

    "Goals and Objectives": "Approximately half of all deaths from heart attacks occur before patients reach the hospital. Although emergency medical service providers commonly give heart attack victims aspirin, better pre-hospital therapies are needed. There has been relatively little improvement in pre-hospital therapy compared to the dramatic advances in therapy after arriving to the hospital. The hypothesis is that the addition of a potent alpha-IIb-beta3 receptor antagonist to standard oral aspirin in the pre-hospital therapy of patients with ST segment-elevated myocardial infarction will not only decrease early mortality, but will also decrease the development of congestive heart failure during the next 6-12 months. Our specific aim is to obtain the pre-IND data needed to advance RUC-4, a novel alpha-IIb-beta3 antagonist, to human studies. RUC-4 was designed to be specific for alpha-IIb-beta3 and to have a unique mechanism of action that not only prevents ligand binding, but also prevents the conformational changes in the beta3 subunit induced by current alpha-IIb-beta3 antagonists that have been implicated in causing thrombocytopenia and paradoxical receptor activation. RUC-4 was also designed to have high solubility so that the likely human dose could be administered by autoinjector. The current alpha-IIb-beta3 antagonists all must be administered intravenously, a major disadvantage for pre-hospital therapy.",

    "Summary": "Each year, approximately 160,000 people in the United States suffer from ST segment-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI), a severe type of heart attack. Approximately half of all deaths from heart attacks occur before patients reach the hospital. Although emergency medical service providers commonly give heart attack victims aspirin, better pre-hospital therapies are needed.The hypothesis is that the addition of a potent alpha-IIb-beta3 receptor antagonist to standard oral aspirin in the pre-hospital therapy of patients with ST segment-elevated myocardial infarction will not only decrease early mortality, but will also decrease the development of congestive heart failure during the next 6-12 months. This hypothesis is based on evidence showing that therapy with other alpha-IIb-beta3 antagonists (along with aspirin) soon after symptom onset can abort the progression of thrombotic myocardial ischemia to irreversible cardiac damage and decrease mortality.This projects aim is to test a compound called RUC-4, an alpha-IIb-beta3 receptor antagonist, and prepare it for human trials.

More than 1.7 million TBIs occur each year in the United States. TBI can cause permanent disability and even death. There is no effective therapy for acute TBI. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease in which the bodys own immune system mistakenly attacks the brain and spinal cord. The symptoms of this condition include trouble seeing, muscle weakness, numbness and tingling, trouble with balance, and problems with thinking and memory. MS affects more than 2.3 million people worldwide. No cure exists for either MS or TBI. In both conditions, damage to brain cells is caused by inflammation, which is the bodys response to injury or infection. Both conditions are common human neurological disorders that affect every age group with long-term consequences, and there is a pressing medical need to bring new, effective therapeutic agents for these diseases to patients.

    "Goals and Objectives": "More than 325,000 cardiac arrests occur each year in the United States. Patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest often suffer devastating brain damage. Therapeutic hypothermia dramatically improves survival with good neurological outcomes in more than half of patients who remain comatose after cardiac arrest. Given this evidence, the American Heart Association and International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) incorporated therapeutic hypothermia into their 2010 treatment guidelines. Medical personnel currently use mechanical methods, including ice bags, cooling pads and endovascular devices to forcefully lower body temperature. Used alone, these methods cannot completely induce hypothermia. As a result, potentially dangerous agents, such as narcotics and paralyzing drugs, must be given to enhance the cooling process, limiting the use of therapeutic hypothermia due to the complexity and increased risk to patients. The collaborators developed HBN-1 as a simple and effective alternative to forced cooling to induce therapeutic hypothermia. HBN-1 causes hypothermia by affecting the hypothalamus, the brain region that controls body temperature.

These metabolic abnormalities can lead to coronary heart disease, liver cirrhosis and certain forms of cancer. Currently, there is no available medication that simultaneously targets all of the metabolic consequences of obesity. Endocannabinoids are lipidlike signaling molecules present in the brain and peripheral tissues. They interact with the same cell surface receptors that also recognize the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, and they produce similar effects, such as an increase in appetite and increased synthesis and decreased degradation of lipids. In recent clinical trials, researchers found that compounds that block the type1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor were effective not only in reducing the weight of obese individuals, but also in reversing their associated insulin resistance, abnormal blood lipid profile and accumulation of fat in the liver.

    "Summary": "In recent clinical trials, researchers found that compounds that block the type1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor were effective not only in reducing the weight of obese individuals, but also in reversing their associated insulin resistance, abnormal blood lipid profile and accumulation of fat in the liver. Unfortunately, these compounds also elicited depression and anxiety, making them unsuitable for therapeutic use. Studies in animal models of obesity have indicated that the beneficial metabolic effects of CB1 receptor blocking drugs is mediated, at least in part, by blockade of CB1 receptors in peripheral tissues, including the liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells, whereas their neuropsychiatric side effects are due to blockage of CB1 receptors in the brain. The investigators modified the chemical structure of currently available CB1-blocking drugs in a way that reduced their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, but that did not affect their oral bioavailability, selectivity and high affinity for the CB1 receptor. The lab has made progress towards the completion of the following studies on JD3057:- Formulation development- Manufacture of drug product to support Phase 1 studies- Pharmacokinetic/absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (PK/ADME) studies- Investigational New Drug (IND)-directed toxicologyAs a result of BrIDGs support, the collaborators were able to file an IND application, which was cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The team is continuing to evaluate a high-dose formulation of JD3057.",

    "Report Title": "Long-Acting Parathyroid Hormone Analog for Treatment of Hypoparathyroidism",
    "Goals and Objectives": "Hypoparathyroidism is a life-long disease characterized by an inadequate production of Parathyroid Hormone (PTH), resulting in hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. Instead of having their missing PTH replaced, affected individuals currently are given large amounts of oral calcium and active vitamin D analogs; treatments that increase the risk of kidney damage (nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis), even if blood calcium levels increase to only the lower end of the normal range. Clinical tests with subcutaneously administered PTH(1-34) and PTH(1-84) peptides of native sequence have demonstrated some efficacy. However, because of its short duration of action, at least two daily injections of PTH(1-34) are needed, and even then, serum calcium levels can fluctuate widely. Moreover, PTH(1-34) therapy often requires continued oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and urinary calcium excretion may not be reduced over the entire day with either PTH peptide. The lead collaborators developed a novel class of long-acting PTH analogs that were selected for their unique biological properties at the PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTHR1). Among several of the long-acting PTH analogs identified, LA-PTH was selected for further development.",

    "Summary": "The lead collaborators at Massachusetts General Hospital developed a novel class of long-acting PTH analogs that were selected for their unique biological properties at the PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTHR1). A single injection of these long-acting PTH peptides leads to a 24- to 48-hour sustained calcemic response in rodents and monkeys, which is accompanied by a sustained reduction in urinary calcium excretion and in blood phosphorus levels. Injection of either wild type PTH(1-34) or PTH(1-84) failed to induce similarly prolonged effects. LA-PTH was selected from among these analogs based on its superior potency in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these data predict that LA-PTH can be more effective as a treatment for hypoparathyroidism than current modalities and that the new analog may be especially valuable for individuals with activating calcium-sensing receptor mutations, a particularly difficult-to-treat patient group who have an even higher risk of nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis under conventional calcium and vitamin D therapy.The team is collaborating on the completion of the following studies: - Synthesis of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and non-GMP material- Formulation development- Manufacture of drug supply for clinical studies- Pharmacokinetic/absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (PK/ADME) studies- Investigational New Drug (IND)-directed toxicology",

    "Report Title": "Development of Nogo Receptor Decoy for the Treatment of Spinal Cord Injury",
    "Goals and Objectives": "Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) cause paralysis and loss of feeling in some or most of the body. Many people with SCIs are permanently disabled, relying on wheelchairs and other assistive devices for their entire lives, and the cost of care is high. An estimated 12,000 SCIs occur every year in the United States, and more than 250,000 Americans are living with SCIs. The spinal cord consists of bundles of nerve fibers, called axons, which carry signals up and down the spinal cord and to the rest of the body. Complete recovery from SCI is normally not possible because these axons are usually damaged and cannot regrow in adults. Partial recovery from SCI may take place within the first few weeks after the injury. Additional recovery beyond that period is limited. Treatment for chronic SCI, therefore, consists primarily of physical and/or occupational therapy. To date, no therapeutic approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) promotes new connections between surviving nerve cells. The team is developing a therapeutic protein, Nogo Receptor Decoy NgR(310)ecto-Fc (AXR-204), to promote the recovery of neurological function through axonal fiber growth after spinal cord injury (SCI). In nearly all neuropathies, a substantial portion of brain and spinal cord is preserved. If the remaining healthy tissue can be rewired with appropriate axonal connections, improved neurological function can occur.",

It is a lysosomal lipid storage disease characterized by defective trafficking of intracellular cholesterol and lysosomal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol, gangliosides and other lipids. Cholesterol accumulates in the liver and the spleen and other fats accumulate in the brain, causing progressive neurodegeneration. In most cases, neurological symptoms appear between the ages of 4 and 10 years, but the disease may not appear until adulthood. The majority of children with the disease die before the age of 20. The lead collaborators are developing a therapy for children with NPC based on a neurosteroid, a hormone that acts on the growth and differentiation of brain cells and is produced in the nervous tissue.

    "Summary": "Neurosteroids, synthesized from cholesterol in the nervous system, affect growth and differentiation of neurons. The lead collaborators showed that post-embryonic neurosteroid synthesis is altered in a time- and region-specific fashion in the BALB/c Niemann-Pick C mouse, and that neurons and glia expressing steroidogenic enzymes are lost. In particular, the synthesis of the GABA-ergic neurosteroid allopregnanolone (ALLO) is substantially diminished at birth, when the rodent brain is still undergoing maturation and decreases further over time. It was demonstrated that appropriately timed treatment of NPC mice with ALLO increases the lifespan of these mice and delays the onset of neurological impairments that are hallmarks of this disease in mice tremor, ataxia, and hindlimb dysfunction. Furthermore, ALLO treatment of NPC mice significantly increases cerebellar Purkinje and granule cell survival and substantially reduces accumulation of cortical gangliosides GM1, GM2 and GM3. The BrIDGs team completed the following activities for the development of ALLO:- Formulation development- Manufacture of GMP drug product- Pharmacokinetic/absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (PK/ADME) studies- Investigational New Drug (IND)-directed toxicologyAs a result of BrIDGs support, the lead collaborator was able to file an IND application, which was cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

This implies not only an anticonvulsant activity, but a potential for disease modification, with 2DG treatment potentially mitigating against chronic consequences of seizures, such as susceptibility to intractability and cognitive and memory dysfunction. These features distinguish 2DG from all currently marketed anticonvulsants.

    "Goals and Objectives": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the buildup of a waxy substance called plaque in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Plaque builds up over time and can eventually narrow arteries and reduce blood flow to the heart, leading to abnormal heart rate, heart attack or heart failure. CHD is the most common type of heart disease and the primary cause of death for men and women in the United States. Having high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol bad cholesterol and low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol good cholesterol increases risk for CHD. Currently, drugs that lower LDL cholesterol are used to help prevent CHD, but they are not completely effective. Scientists have recently explored the therapeutic effects of giving HDL cholesterol to patients with CHD at high risk for a heart attack. These investigators are developing a drug that mimics the effects of apoA-1, a building block of HDL cholesterol. The drug would increase HDL levels in the blood to treat and prevent CHD.",

    "Summary": "Existing drugs that lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) are not fully adequate for preventing coronary heart disease (CHD). It has become increasingly evident that therapeutic agents for raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL) would be a useful addition to our current treatment approach. The recent unraveling of some of the complexities of HDL metabolism has led to the identification of key proteins involved in the biogenesis of HDL, giving new hope and ideas for drug targets. In spite of this, therapies using small molecules to raise HDL have been elusive. Recently, a potential new treatment strategy for CHD, called acute HDL therapy, has been described. The strategy involves a weekly intravenous infusion of HDL into patients with acute coronary syndrome. A five-week course of this therapy has been shown to rapidly reduce atherosclerotic plaques. This project involves a short synthetic peptide mimic of apoA-1, (peptide 5A), which potentially can be used instead of recombinant apoA-1 in acute HDL therapy. Peptide 5A attenuates the development of atherosclerotic plaque in pre-clinical models of atherosclerosis, including APOE-deficient mice, and impairs macrophage recruitment and foam cell formation in the rabbit collar model. In vitro assays have demonstrated that 5A specifically interacts with the cholesterol efflux transporter ABCA1 and catalyzes the efflux of cholesterol from macrophages.The collaboration includes the completion of the following ongoing studies on 5A: - Synthesis of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and non-GMP material- Formulation development- Manufacture of drug product for clinical trials- Pharmacokinetic/absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (PK/ADME) studies- Investigational New Drug (IND)-directed toxicology",

    "Summary": "The Analytical Chemistry team has continued to perform the core responsibility of purifying samples with material in the range of milligrams to grams. Major and minor components ( &LT; 0.1 percent) have been isolated for additional testing and characterization. The teams automated sample processing protocol allows for dispensing into 1D barcoded vials, Matrix 2D barcoded tubes and/or 96-well plates for efficient tracking, storing and testing. The entire process from receiving the sample to final plating is completed within one week. While the group uses a variety of liquid chromatographs to determine identity and purity, single quadrupole liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry instrumentation is utilized for high-throughput automated analysis. Due to the wide variety of analytes tested, the teams range of analytical detectors includes ultraviolet (UV), mass spectrometry (MS; positive and negative mode), and evaporative light scattering detector and fluorescence (ELSD). Time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF/MS) is employed to achieve formula confirmation and identity determination of unknowns.The chemical and enantiomeric purity of chiral compounds is routinely determined within the groups full scale chiral laboratory. Methods development with the chiral chromatography screening protocol involves the utilization of various chiral stationary phases in conjunction with multiple mobile phase conditions. The use of an inline chiral detector allows for the determination of relative optical rotation. Sample purification on a scale of up to hundreds of milligrams is possible. We continued to expand our chiral column collection to meet the increasing demands of collaborators related to the type and quantity of compounds submitted for chiral separation. Furthermore, we are still working with the DPI Informatics group to incorporate vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectrometry into our routine workflow as a technique for determining the absolute configuration of isolated chiral compounds.The expansion of DPIs focus beyond small molecules to alternate therapeutic modalities has necessitated an increase in our NMR and MS analytical capabilities through the acquisition and incorporation of more advanced instrumentation and techniques in order to detect, identify, quantify, and validate these new chemical entities. For NMR spectroscopy, this has involved the use of Residual Dipolar Coupling (RDC) and Residual Chemical Shift Anisotropy (RCSA) analysis in the determination of structural configuration and conformation. Also, peptides are being explored as highly specific and potent enzyme inhibitors and we have begun NMR analysis of these more complex structures. For mass spectrometry, we have purchased state-of-the-art instrumentation that will aid in high-throughput MS sample analysis. The Orbitrap Fusion Lumos MS system will enable us to perform top-down proteomics including post-translational modification analysis. This will be of great use for TRNDs newly established antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) screening platform, as well as many other projects requiring intact protein analysis. The Rapiflex MALDI system, which involves a collaborative effort between Biology, Automation, and Analytical Chemistry is central to DPIs imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) initiative. Lastly, drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a major concern in drug discovery research as most patients are taking several medications concurrently. Since it has been well established that cytochrome P450 inhibition can be a major cause for DDIs, knowing a drug candidates CYP450 inhibition potential is of great interest. As such, a collaboration with the DMPK group was started to develop a high-throughput RapidFire-MS/MS assay for cytochrome P450 inhibition studies in support of NCATS drug discovery research. The Sample Management and Resource Tracking (SMART) system, our proprietary LIMS, continues to be utilized at DPI for sample submission, compound purification, compound processing, sample registration, compound inventory, sample tracking, data retrieval, and data management. As SMART is constantly evolving based on changing workflows and scientist needs, we have add required functionality while also streamlining user interfaces and the underlying scripting, which has led to a more robust and efficient system. We have continued our efforts of migrating SMART to a unified platform. Working with NCATS OIT, we have redesigned the user interface to provide users with a streamlined dashboard for comprehensive access to all project related data. Additionally, the SMART Consumables, Acquisitions, and Reagent Tracker (SmartCART) has been successfully transitioned to the unified platform. The higher level of integration coupled with expanded functionality has allowed SmartCART to move closer to becoming NCATSs primary system for the requisition, organization, and management of scientific related orders. The upgraded ordering system has been rolled out to DPIs current users with intended expansion to all NCATS in 6 months.",

The mission of the Tox21 Program is to develop more efficient and less time-consuming approaches to evaluate the effect of environmental chemicals on human health. The main focus of the Tox21 Program is to screen thousands and thousands of chemicals using a group of in vitro cell assays with target/pathway-specificity and mechanism-driven, and to help prioritize chemicals for more extensive testing using secondary and lower throughput methods including traditional in vivo methods. The ultimate goal for Tox21 is to develop strategies for agencies to use in regulating chemicals and reducing the current reliance on animal testing for toxicological evaluations. To carry out this mission, the goals of the Tox21 Program are to: (1) identify environmental chemicals that lead to biological responses and determine their mechanisms of action on biological systems, (2) prioritize the testing compounds for more extensive toxicological evaluation, (3) develop models that predict chemicals adverse health effects in humans, and (4) annotate all human biochemical pathways and design assays (tests) that can measure these pathways responses to chemicals. The Tox21 Program is a collaborative effort that encompassed the work of three NCATS teams: Systems Toxicology, Genomic Toxicology, and Computational Toxicology. Specifically, the Tox21 Systems Toxicology team has led the effort to develop and validate a battery of in vitro cell-based assays in a quantitative high-throughput screening platform. Their goals are to study the mechanism of action of environmental chemicals and to prioritize compounds for further toxicological study. The team has also generated a group of assays that can be used to screen environmental chemicals for evaluating their environmental toxicology.",

The Tox21 Program is comprised of three NCATS teams: Systems Toxicology, Genomic Toxicology, and Computational Toxicology.The Systems Toxicology team has identified, developed, optimized, and/or screened more than 19 assays. Highlights range from performing 5 online screens, including caspase 3/7 assays in CHO and HepG2 cells, human pregnane X receptor in triplicate and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme-based assay with or without metabolic capability in single against the Tox21 10K compound collection and 5 online validation assays, including enzyme-based AChE assay with or without liver microsomes assays, against the LOPAC collection on the Tox21 robotic system. All of these assays were optimized and evaluated before moving to robotic online validation and online screening. AChE is the primary cholinesterase in the body that metabolizes a key neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. Inhibition of AChE activity can lead to neurotoxicity and known inhibitors include organophosphorus pesticides, chemical warfare agents, drugs, and various phytochemicals. In collaboration with the CFSAN/FDA, the Systems Toxicology team has screened two cell-based AChE assays with fluorescence and color metric readouts in a homogenous format against the Tox21 10K compound collection. In addition, enzyme-based AChE assays with or without liver microsomes have been developed and validated against a group of known AChE inhibitors that need metabolism to become active compounds. In addition, the team has worked with NTP, EPA and FDA on the mitochondria project and tested 34 compounds identified from the primary screening in the follow-up assays including reactive oxygen species (ROS), p53 and Nrf2/ARE (antioxidant response element), mitochondrial oxygen consumption, Parkin translocation, and larval development and ATP status in the C. elegans. Known mitochondrial complex inhibitors (e.g., rotenone) and un-couplers (e.g., chlorfenapyr), as well as potential novel complex inhibitors and un-couplers, were detected. The team has also optimized and validated in vitro co-culture angiogenesis assay in a 1536-well plate format by screening a drug collection contacting 2816 compounds in a high content imager. From the screen, many known angiogenesis inhibitors were identified such as topotecan, docetaxel, and bortezomib. Several potential novel angiogenesis inhibitors were also identified from this study including thimerosal and podofilox. Among the inhibitors, some compounds were proved to be involved in the hypoxia inducible factor-1-alpha (HIF-1) and the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) pathways.The estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERR) is an orphan nuclear receptor (NR) that plays a role in energy homeostasis and controls mitochondrial oxidative respiration. In collaboration with NIEHS, we identified more than five agonist clusters including statin cluster based on compound structural similarity analysis (e.g., statins) after primary screening. We also performed follow-up assays (e.g., siRNA knockdown) we identified compounds that might act as endocrine disrupters through effects on ERR signaling. In addition, the team has identified a group of CAR activators and deactivators from the primary screening. Several follow-up studies including CAR translocation in human hepatocytes have been performed to confirm the compounds with CAR activity.",

The mission of the Tox21 Program is to develop more efficient and less time-consuming approaches to predict how chemicals may affect human health. The main focus of the Tox21 Program is to help prioritize chemicals for more extensive testing using secondary and lower throughput methods including traditional in vivo methods. Tox21s ultimate goal is to develop strategies for agencies to use in regulating chemicals and reducing the current reliance on animal testing for toxicological evaluations. To carry out this mission, the goals of the Tox21 Program are to: (1) identify environmental chemicals that lead to biological responses and determine their mechanisms of action on biological systems, (2) prioritize the testing compounds for more extensive toxicological evaluation, (3) develop models that predict chemicals adverse health effects in humans, and (4) annotate all human biochemical pathways and design assays (tests) that can measure these pathways responses to chemicals. The Tox21 Program is a collaborative effort that encompassed the work of three NCATS teams: Systems Toxicology, Genomic Toxicology, and Computational Toxicology. Specifically, the Genomic Toxicology team aims to develop in vitro methods to identify toxic compounds by introducing differentiating stem cell models and the gene expression technologies such as single cell RNA-seq. These new technologies support efforts to reach several goals: (1) identify potentially toxic chemicals in the environment through the Tox21 consortium, (2) quantify the sensitivity of human cardiovascular cells to individual chemical components of tobacco smoke, and (3) facilitate drug development through the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases program.",

The Tox21 Program is comprised of three NCATS teams: Systems Toxicology, Genomic Toxicology, and Computational Toxicology. The Genomic Toxicology group has used the Toxmatrix method (Tong 2018) to identify pathways that render neurons susceptible to 32 neurodegenerative toxicants investigated. Toxmatrix interactions identified iron transport, and oxidative metabolism as characteristic neuronal toxicity pathways. Transcriptional profiling of neurotoxicants has identified seven transcriptionally-induced biomarker genes that are particularly responsive to toxicants that cause, or increase risk for, Parkinsons disease (PD). These chemical interactions, culture conditions, and biomarkers, are being used to develop a qHTS assay to screen chemical libraries to identify potential neurodegenerative toxicants. The Genomic Toxicology and Computational Toxicology groups have also advanced high-throughput gene expression technology. In 2018, we worked with Computational Toxicology to adapt our Point-of-Departure (POD) algorithm to RNAseq, and applied it to identify endothelial cell gene responses to chemicals from tobacco smoke that lead to heart attack and stroke. The POD algorithm revealed multiple toxico-dynamic effects of individual chemicals that accumulated as the toxicant concentration was increased; a reductive analysis of the toxicological principle The dose makes the poison.",

The Tox21 Program can be separated into three NCATS teams: Systems Toxicology, Genomic Toxicology, and Computational Toxicology. The Tox21 Computational Toxicology team has enhanced a variety of tools that are routinely used by Tox21 partners to access each others data. The team performed data analysis of more than 18 assays that were identified, developed, optimized, and/or screened by the Tox21 systems toxicology team and gene expression data generated by the Tox21 Genomic Toxicology team. These activities include normalization and correction, fitting of concentration-response curves to generate potency and efficacy measures, classification of curves based on a set of criteria that included significance of fit (measured by p-values), completeness of fit, and efficacy, evaluation of assay performance by data reproducibility, data driven selection of compounds for follow up studies, and identification of genes and pathways involved in cell responses to chemical exposure. In addition, the Tox21 Computational Toxicology team has updated the web-based, automated structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis tool for the systems toxicology team to conduct SAR analysis on all 10K library screens. The Tox21 Computational Toxicology team has also updated the PubChem deposition tool to facilitate the deposition of the Tox21 10K triplicate screen data into PubChem. The 10K data from all assays screened up to FY17 have been made public in PubChem totaling 191 assay entries (AIDs) and over 85 million data points. The Tox21 public data browser has been updated with the latest assay results from the 10K library screens totaling 54 assays. This browser provides the public with visualization of Tox21 qHTS data including concentration-response curves, curve fitting results and different activity metrics along with chemical structure and analytical QC results. Data are searchable by assay and/or chemical. Results from multiple assays and/or chemicals can be overlaid for ease of comparison. All data as well as assay descriptions and detailed screening protocols (SLPs) are available for download. The Tox21 data download site has been updated with new assay result files in the column format, combing raw data and corrected data, for ease of analysis by other Tox21 partners. The Tox21 Computational Toxicology team has continued to work with the Tox21 chemical working group to generate PDF files for the Tox21 10K library chemical QC results, including the 4-month compound stability test results. These results have been released in the public Tox21 Browser (https://tripod.nih.gov/tox21/) and the links to the PDFs have been provided for Tox21 compounds deposited in PubChem. In FY17, the Tox21 Computational Toxicology team has been working with other NCATS teams to update the NCATS Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC), which is part of the Tox21 10K compound library, with drugs approved in recent years to include an up-to-date list of all approved drugs. Furthermore, the Web based browser for the NCATS BioPlanet database has been updated including a tutorial page. The BioPlanet collects a list of all human pathways that allow the Tox21 Program to design assays to measure their chemical responses. The BioPlanet currently annotates nearly 1,700 unique human pathways by source, biological function and process, disease and toxicity relevance, and availability of probing assays. This tool has been made available (https://tripod.nih.gov/bioplanet/) to the Tox21 partners and the public in FY17. In addition, the Tox21 Computational Toxicology team has continued to work with the Tox21 Genomic Toxicology team to refine methods for concentration response gene expression data analysis including strategies for point-of-departure (PoD) determination, as well as combination screening data analysis of toxicants and modulators (the ToxMatrix).

    "Summary": "Small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules are pieces of RNA that block the activity of genes through a natural process called RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi has emerged as a powerful tool used in thousands of labs worldwide to understand gene function. By blocking or modulating a genes function, RNAi can tell us about the role of any gene in maintaining health or causing disease, an invaluable step in identifying potential drug targets. In tests called genome-wide RNAi screens, scientists use automation to introduce siRNAs into human cells to block the activity of each gene, one at a time. This process can produce a complete list of all genes involved in a particular biological function or disease process. Scientists also can use these techniques to understand what roles genes play in drug effectiveness.RNAis potential usefulness has been limited by the lack of expertise to perform genome-wide RNAi screens, the lack of methodologies that can properly interpret these experiments and the absence of comprehensive RNAi data in public databases for researchers to reference. To address these problems, NCATS operates a state-of-the-art RNAi screening facility known as the Trans-NIH RNAi Facility (TNRF), and NCATS staff assists NIH intramural investigators with all stages of project planning and execution. The initiative provides public access to RNAi data generated from these experiments through the National Library of Medicines PubChem database. In addition, siRNA sequence information is available from private-sector biotechnology partners. For instance, researchers can access Life Technologies Silencer Select siRNA library, which includes 65,000 siRNA sequences that target more than 20,000 human genes. The RNAi high-throughput screening facility, administered by NCATS Division of Pre-Clinical Innovation staff, offers a robotic platform with integrated, automated devices for conducting all aspects of screening assays (tests), including manipulating chemicals and cells, reading the results and imaging the cells. Offline (non-robotic) devices can perform smaller-scale work from assay optimization through medium-scale screening. Investigators have the option of using several different siRNA libraries and other small molecules involved in RNAi. For data analysis, the facility offers powerful computational tools.In addition to enabling collaborations on specific projects, TNRF staff work to develop methods that advance the science of RNAi screening and informatics and pursue new technologies for exploring gene function. Currently, NCATS scientists are working on developing a platform that offers complementary high-throughput genomic technologies to advance the field of functional genomics. They are performing multiple screens in order to optimize this platform. The goal is to speed scientific discoveries in all disease areas. Project areas include cancer (drug enhancer/resistance screens, development of 3D metastasis screens, molecular targets in cancer, and cancer-related pathways), infectious diseases (viral infection and replication such as Zika virus, HIV, Ebola virus, and Hepatitis C virus), fundamental cell biology (DNA replication and reprogramming/differentiation), and other disease-related phenotypes (Parkinsons disease, diabetes, and fragile X syndrome).",

    "Summary": "Depression remains a serious medical illness for over 10 million Americans annually. For a large percentage, the existing treatment options fail, and there are no current options for these individuals. Recently, the sedative/anesthetic ketamine has been discovered to possess activity in treatment-resistant depression. There remain, however, issues in its realization as an effective therapeutic option, including its addictive potential and psychotomimetic properties. Working with researchers at NIMH and the University of Maryland, we are exploring the potential that a naturally occurring metabolite of ketamine is the agent responsible for its anti-depressant activity. In a cadre of studies this key metabolite recapitulates all depression-relative phenotypes of ketamine without the addictive or psychotomimetic effects. Efforts to establish a pharmaceutical form of this agent for initiation of a clinical trial are currently underway.",

    "Summary": "The selection, acquisition and use of high-quality, small-molecule libraries for screening are an essential aspect of drug discovery and chemical biology programs. Screening libraries continue to evolve as researchers gain a greater appreciation of the suitability of small molecules for specific biological targets, processes and environments. The decisions surrounding the make-up of any given small molecule library is informed by a multitude of variables, and opinions vary on best-practices. The fitness of any collection relies upon upfront filtering to avoid problematic compounds, assess appropriate physicochemical properties, install the ideal level of structural uniqueness and determine the desired extent of molecular complexity. These criteria are under constant evaluation and revision as academic and industrial organizations seek out collections that yield ever-improving results from their screening portfolios. Practical questions including cost, compound management, screening sophistication and assay objective also play a significant role in the choice of library composition. Our team continues to develop novel libraries including the Mechanism Interrogation Plate or MIPE and a novel stable metabolite library for use in both single agent and combination screening platforms. These libraries represent important tools for studying multiple models of disease.",

    "Summary": "Chemical Technology researchers develop small molecule and screening approaches that other scientists can use to pursue innovations in therapeutic development. O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is an essential enzyme that catalyzes the attachment of O-GlcNAc residues to nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins including kinases, transcription factors, histones and many other proteins which, in turn, regulate numerous cellular processes. O-GlcNAcylation is still not well understood, and small molecule inhibitors of OGT will be a key tool for the dissecting of this important enzymes function in the cell. Working with the Walker lab (Harvard), we have developed a novel small molecule OGT inhibitor and validated its activity in several different mammalian cell lines without affecting synthesis of cell surface N- or O-linked glycans. We are continuing to optimize this agent and are pursuing numerous collaborations using this probe of OGT biology to delineate its role in multiple cell lines and disease settings.",

    "Goals and Objectives": "In the last several decades, there have been tremendous advances in hospital-based treatment of heart attacks. In short, more people are surviving myocardial infarctions. Unfortunately, these individuals experience significant morbidity and a lower quality of life due to the tissue death that occurs during the key hours between symptom onset and interventional therapy while under the treatment of a physician. Our team has optimized a novel aIIbB3 antagonist in collaboration with the Coller lab (Rockefeller). This agent currently is being vetted as a clinical reagent to be administered alongside standard oral aspirin in the pre-hospital therapy of patients with ST segment-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI).",

    "Summary": "There has been relatively little improvement in pre-hospital therapy compared to the dramatic advances in therapy after arriving to the hospital. The addition of a potent aIIbB3 antagonist administered alongside standard oral aspirin in the pre-hospital therapy of patients with ST segment-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) has the potential to decrease early mortality and the development of congestive heart failure during the next 6-12 months. This hypothesis is based on evidence showing that therapy with other aIIbB3 antagonists (along with aspirin) soon after symptom onset can abort the progression of thrombotic myocardial ischemia to irreversible cardiac damage and decrease mortality. Moreover, we expect a favorable safety profile since patients will neither be anticoagulated nor undergo arterial access in the pre-hospital setting, and the effects will wear off within 2-4 hours. The current aIIbB3 antagonists all must be administered intravenously, a major disadvantage for pre-hospital therapy. We currently are gathering the needed Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling data to advance RUC-4, a novel aIIbB3 antagonist, to human studies. Based on crystallographic structural studies of aIIbB3, RUC-4 was designed to be specific for aIIbB3 and to have a unique mechanism of action that not only prevents ligand binding, but also prevents the conformational changes in the 3 subunit induced by current aIIbB3 antagonists patterned on the R(K)GD sequence that have been implicated in causing thrombocytopenia and paradoxical receptor activation. RUC-4 was also designed to have high solubility (80 mg/ml) so that the likely human dose (1 mg/kg) can be administered in 1 ml by autoinjector. Based on studies in mice and non-human primates, RUC-4 is rapidly absorbed after intramuscular injection. In non-human primates, platelet aggregation was eliminated within 15 minutes after a 0.27 ml IM dose of 1.93 mg/kg with partial return of platelet aggregation after 4.5 hours. A lower dose (0.47 ml; 1 mg/kg) produced partial inhibition of aggregation at 15 minutes, complete inhibition at 30 minutes, and partial return of aggregation at 2 hours. Thus, the current profile for RUC4 matches the anticipated needs for a pre-hospital therapy of patients with ST segment-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI).",

    "Summary": "Matrix screening at NCATS aims to identify synergistic drug combinations for the treatment of multiple diseases using a quantitative high-throughput combinatorial screening platform. A customized informatics interface allows for the facile identification of antagonistic, additive and synergistic outcomes. Our approach facilitates the visualization of potency shifts, as well as efficacy enhancements for drugs in combination across a myriad of phenotypic assays. The standards of care for many diseases, including therapies for multiple types of cancer, involve drug combinations. Drug regimens can be comprised of as many as five or more agents such as R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin doxorubicin, oncovin vincristine, and prednisone) which is commonly used for the treatment of non-Hodgkins lymphomas. Many of these therapies are the result of long and painstaking clinical trial-and-error. The identification of clinically useful combination therapies in this way is untenable and methods to discover translatable drug combinations in pre-clinical settings are urgently needed. NCATS researchers have, therefore, established a high-throughput platform for analyzing drugs in combination. The outcomes of these studies include both basic research discoveries (novel interactions between diverse signaling pathways) and translational (discovery of new drug combinations for clinical evaluation). Highlighted projects include:-Identification of drugs that amplify the actions of ibrutinib in B-cell driven cancers;-Evaluation of the combinatorial drug landscape for malaria;-Identification of drugs that combine with Jak inhibitors in human IL-2 dependent adult T-cell leukemia;-Immunotoxin-based drug combinations for the treatment of epithelial and hematologic cancers;-Drug combinations for combating Ebola.",

With financial support from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth Association (CMTA) and in collaboration with CMT investigators we are designing and functionally validating novel assays for use in early stage translational research. CMT Type 1A (Collaboration with J. Svaren). More than half of the genetically diagnosed cases of CMT are caused by a chromosomal duplication affecting a critical myelin gene, Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 (PMP22). Since increased expression levels of PMP22 cause this neuropathy (classified as CMT1A), the simplest strategy for treatment is to achieve a relatively subtle ( &LT; 2-fold) change in PMP22 regulation. Proof-of-principle studies have shown that reducing PMP22 levels leads to beneficial effects in rodent models of CMT1A. Therefore, we have developed novel assays for small molecule screening to identify compounds that effectively lower PMP22 expression and treat the root cause of CMT1A. We have designed and functionally validated novel assays for use in quantitative HTS that accurately reflect the physiological regulation of the PMP22 gene. This work follows an iterative design-build-test model enabling integration of advances in assay technology with key aspects of the disease physiology to achieve state-of-the-art bioassays compatible with ultra-high throughput testing platforms. Our initial assay designs using PMP22 regulatory elements driving expression of reporter genes as a surrogate of PMP22 gene expression. Second generation assays now utilize the groundbreaking approach of genome editing to insert reporters at the endogenous PMP22 locus, which allows physiological regulation of the reporter in the native chromatin environment. The assays created in this manner will be able to identify both transcriptional and post-transcriptional (e.g. miRNA-mediated) effects. One of these assays is now in use at the pharmaceutical company, Sanofi-Genzyme in a parallel effort to identify novel chemical starting points for a CMT1A therapeutic. In subsequent designs we incorporate a coincidence biocircuit reporter, developed in our laboratory to increase the fidelity of the assays by greatly minimizing the selection of reporter-specific inhibitors which can, depending on the chemical library composition, outnumber and confound selection of candidate compounds of interest. To achieve the ultimate goal of identifying small molecules that can therapeutically reduce PMP22 levels in treatment of CMT1A, we participated in an R21-funded project with an aim to perform a quantitative high throughput screen (qHTS) of the extensive molecular libraries small molecule resources at NCATS. We are now following up with the finding from a large-scale qHTS.",

Consistent with genetic studies in Drosophila that indicate PINK1 functions upstream of Parkin in the same pathway, biochemical and cell biology studies show that PINK1 recruits Parkin to damaged mitochondria where Parkin can induce selective autophagy of damaged mitochondria . PINK1 is a kinase that has been shown to phosphorylate Parkin to trigger Parkin association with mitochondria. Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates scores of substrates on mitochondria. These ubiquitinated substrates recruit adaptors such as p62 to mitochondria that are thought to be key for initiating autophagosome recognition of damaged mitochondria. Parkin activity through mitophagy or alternative pathways protects neurons from a variety of stresses. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that increasing Parkin expression improves mitochondria quality control and protects dopaminergic neurons from mitochondrial stressors associated with aging. As aging is regarded as the primary risk factor for sporadic PD, it is logical the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria is an attractive avenue for therapeutic intervention. We seek to discover and validate drugs that boost Parkin expression level and ubiquitin ligase activity to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and neuron loss in PD.",

Peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs): AMP deaminase (AMPD) deficiency: In collaboration with K. Nagaraju (Children's National Medical Center) the ADST laboratory is developing a coincidence reporter assay to aid in the discovery of compounds that increase expression of the enzyme AMP deaminase implicated in the disease idiopathic inflammatory myositis (IIM). IIM is a rare autoimmune progressive disease that afflicts the skeletal muscle of patients. IIM is comprised of errors in both immune regulation and intrinsic muscle metabolism. AMP deaminase (AMPD) catalyzes the deamination of AMP to IMP. In humans AMPD activity is encoded by at least three genes. AMPD isoforms have tissue specific expression patterns in adults and stage specific expression patterns during the muscle development. Drugs which stimulate the expression of AMPD1 are hypothesized to reverse muscle weakness. Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA): In collaboration with D. Bodine (NHGRI, NIH) and G. Thomas (U. Cincinnati) the ADST laboratory is developing assay strategies as part of a translational research project for DBA a rare, congenital disease seen in all ethnic groups with a frequency of 7 cases per million live births. The diagnosis is usually made in the 1st yr of life, as a severe anemia that requires transfusion. Unlike other anemias, DBA patients have no reticulocytes in peripheral blood indicating a failure of erythropoiesis whereas production of the white cells and platelets are unaffected. For a small minority of patients, bone marrow transplantation from a healthy sibling is a curative therapy. For patients without a suitable donor a variety of palliative therapies that can prolong life into the third decade. Current treatments include corticosteroid therapy, which results in reduced growth and other complications, or lifelong transfusion and iron chelation.Discovery of Drugs for inherited rare blinding retinal degenerations: Donald J. Zack, M.D., Ph.D., a Johns Hopkins researcher funded by the Foundation Fighting Blindness, is collaborating with Dr. Ingleses ADST laboratory in a public-private partnership aimed at alleviating and curing blinding retinal degenerative diseases. Together they are utilizing ADSTs expertise in assay development, chemical biology and quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) to develop assays and chemical library testing paradigms to identify drugs and compounds that have the potential to save and restore vision for people affected by devastating retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in Americans over 50 years of age. The use of primary rodent retinal cells, a limiting cell type typical for typical HTS experiments, benefits from the low-volume assay technology employed in the Inglese laboratory at NCATS. Development of a cell-based high throughput quantitative microscopy-based assay for glucose-regulating multienzyme compartment: In collaboration with S. An (UMBC) the ADST laboratory of NCATS is developing a 1536-well plate format high throughput quantitative microscopy-based assay for discovery of compounds that modulate the formation of a dynamically assembled multienzyme complex regulating glucose-derived carbon flux in cells. Given that glucose metabolism is the central metabolic pathway that balances the cellular needs for both energy and building blocks, the pilot screening of pharmacologically active small molecules for or against the assembly will assist to understand the biological significance of the assembly in the cell. In turn, extensive high throughput screening is anticipated to discover novel pharmacophores, which promote or disrupt the assembly in human disease models, for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of glucose metabolism-associated human diseases. Exploration of novel sources of chemical libraries for antimalarial activity: To probe the biological activity of the stereochemical and structural complexity of novel academic chemical libraries and the chemical diversity of natural products extracts (NPEs) the ADST laboratory is testing the antimalarial potential of these chemical repositories.

Snyder (BU), X.-z., Su (NIAID, NIH), the ADST laboratory has determined EC50s for Plasmodium falciparum viability for each of 2,070 members of the Boston University CMLD compound collection and &RT; 16,00 NPEs assembled at the University of Michigan using quantitative high-throughput screening across five parasite lines of distinct geographic origin. From the BU library three compound classes displaying either differential or comprehensive antimalarial activity across the lines were identified. From the NPE library a novel recently discovered compound, called Actinoramide A was found to display potent antimalarial activity. The molecular basis for the activity of these compounds is being investigated. Assays for the identification of small molecules up-regulating Scn1a gene expression. Dravet syndrome, a severe epileptic disorder, is caused by nonsense mutations in the SCN1A gene resulting in a non-functional protein. In collaboration with V. Broccoli (Institute of Neuroscience, Milan) we are developing mouse ES cells, capable of differentiation to neurons, containing a coincidence reporter biocircuit edited into the genetic locus encoding the alpha subunit of the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel. Small molecules that up-regulate the unaffected allele of SCN1A may provide a compensatory mechanism for disease treatment. Controlling cellular senescence with small molecule compounds modulating the 133p53 isoform: In collaboration with C. Harris (NCI) the ADST laboratory of NCATS is developing a 1536-well plate format high throughput laser-cytometry based assay for discovery of compounds that modulate the cellular distribution and half-life of specific p53 isoform in cells. The demonstrated functional and regulatory role served by 133p53 between cellular senescence and autophagy is relevant to both aging and cancer. Compounds effective in modulating cellular phenotypes based on expression of a GFP- 133p53 sensor will be explored for their pharmacological effect in relevant aging and cancer model systems.",

    "Summary": "This project includes the development of biochemical and target-focused assays based on specific protein or nucleic acid targets implicated in disease. The assay designs are considered in the context of analysis and progression strategies for evaluation of a wide range of compound classes using high throughput screening technologies. There is a strong emphasis on methods development research to advance assay and lead discovery efficiency. Complementing these activities we also explore and devise approaches for the interrogation of complex chemical libraries (e.g., natural product extracts, mRNA display). The work from this program is used to support a range of grant applications and prototype projects. The following are on-going:Targeting protein palmitoylation with small molecules. In collaboration with A. Banerjee (NICHD, NIH) we are developing 1536-well compatible protein palmitoyl acyl transferase assays to evaluate chemical libraries for potential inhibitors of the enzyme as possible therapeutic leads for the large number of diseases to which this class of enzyme have been linked. These compounds are also anticipated to have value as structural, functional and pharmacological probes.Strategies for the discovery of small molecule ligands of RNA. In collaboration with Prof. N. Baird (U. Sciences) we are exploring assay designs to probe the interaction of small molecules with non-coding gene-regulatory mRNAs. The research has the potential of the discovery of novel antibiotics or anticancer agents. Assay development to enable discovery of novel small molecule antagonists of the receptor guanylate cyclase Npr1. In collaboration with M. Hoon (NIDCR, NIH) we are developing and testing novel assays of the b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) receptor, Npr1. Recently the agonist, BNP was shown to be required for the transmission of itch sensation between peripheral and spinal cord nerves. The Npr1 assays will be used to identify antagonists for use in pharmacological treatments of chronic itch, a condition that results in long-term unremitting urge to scratch that significantly degrades the quality of life for sufferers. SIRPa-CD47 Protein-protein interaction. In collaboration with T. Miller (Paradigm Shift Therapeutics) and D. Roberts (NCI, NIH) our goal is to leverage the broad potential of CD47 as a molecular target in a number of tumors to create therapeutics that protect normal tissue from chemo and radiation therapy while differentially enhancing the effects of these therapies on the tumor. We are currently reengineering a medium throughput biochemical CD47 ligand binding assay to a higher throughput system capable of screening a larger number of molecules.Chorismate mutase inhibitors. In collaboration with J. Padia (PrimeTime Life Sciences) this project seeks to develop a quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) assay for the identification of small molecule inhibitors of chorismate mutase (CM). CM is an important enzyme found in plants and microorganisms required for the biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. Mammals cannot carry out the de novo biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids and must rely on dietary sources. Thus, a potent and selective drug-like inhibitor of CM would be a valuable antimicrobial agent, particularly for antimicrobial resistant infections.Targeting G proteins with small molecules. Fibrous dysplasia of bone (McCune-Albright syndrome) is a hyperfunctioning endocrinopathy resulting from mis-sense mutations in the small -subunit of the G-protein, Gs leading to increased levels of cellular cAMP. The aim of this project is to develop a biochemical assay suitable for qHTS using the R201C mutant form of Gs to identify small molecules capable of antagonizing the R201C Gs adenylyl cyclase-activating conformation.",

The pilot phase of the program developed a website, called Pharos, that integrates information about understudied proteins so that researchers everywhere can easily access it, catalyzing their own research and helping them find new proteins that may be of interest. In addition, IDG supported researchers developed technologies to enable the study of understudied druggable proteins in a high throughput manner. During 2017, IDG was approved for a second stage of funding, called the Implementation Phase. During the Implementation Phase, IDG aims to expand the informatics tools developed in the Pilot Phase, elucidate the function of understudied proteins from three key druggable protein familes (GPCRs, ion channels, and kinases), and disseminate the IDG-generated resources to the greater scientific community.

To aid in this goal, this project aims to use disease-in-a-dish models using neurons and astrocytes generated from ASD patients to identify potential ASD therapies. Strong evidences suggest that ASD are diseases of synapses. By studying human neurons and astrocytes separately the Muotri Lab has shown that neurons alone have limited ability to form synapses. However, when co-cultured in the presence of astrocytes, functional synapses are formed. ASD-derived astrocytes showed misregulation of cytokines and reduced glutamate uptake, affecting synaptogenesis and neuronal homeostasis when compared to controls. This project aims to utilize high throughput screening to rescue the ASD-derived astrocytes cytokine signature.",

In several human cancers the Wip1 protein is overexpressed and the PPM1D gene is amplified, which is generally associated with a worse prognosis. Inhibition of Wip1 activity is established as a possible way to limit the growth of tumors that retain wild-type p53. Conversely, transient activation of Wip1 in a p53-negative environment might provide a basis for novel anticancer treatments, due to pro-apoptotic functions of Wip1 activity. Therefore, potent inhibitors and activators of Wip1 could have a broad clinical impact.

    "Goals and Objectives": "Demyelinating diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis, have been of utmost interest within the last couple of decades, though no treatment exists yet in preventing remyelination failure in the chronic stages of these diseases. This project aims to identify compounds capable of promoting oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) remyelination with a view to developing novel small molecule therapies for stimulating remyelination in affected patients. At a center-wide level, the NCATS Chemical Genomic Center's overall goal is to uncover new small molecule therapeutics and catalyze the process of therapeutic development through a model of collaborative research. With each collaboration, NIH and extramural disease experts work with the NCGCs drug discovery teams, who provide access to small molecule screening, medicinal chemistry and informatics expertise. The objectives of the NCGC are: 1. Collaborate with both NIH and extramural investigators to advance small molecule screening projects for disease targets (assay development, screening and validation) and help characterize the underlying biology. 2. Pursue new technologies for target-based and phenotypic screening, as well as for downstream validation. 3. Provide characterized small molecule probes against identified targets to act as tools for future research, and as starting points for drug development campaigns. 4.

Although advances in direct-acting antiviral therapy has led to significant improvements in sustained virologic response rate and overall success, treatment regimes remain prohibitively costly and the development of viral resistance is still a significant problem. This project aims to identify novel small molecule HCV replication inhibitors, ideally with unique mechanism(s) of action. High-throughput screening efforts will be used to identify compounds capable of halting viral replication.

    "Goals and Objectives": "Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene result in Gaucher disease, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder. Many of the mutations encountered in patients with Gaucher disease are missense alterations that may cause misfolding, decreased stability and/or mistrafficking of this lysosomal protein. To this end, the project team is developing small molecule modulators of glucocerebrosidase to help study cellular trafficking in these patients, and serve as starting points for therapeutics for Gaucher's disease, which is currently only treatable through enzyme replacement therapy. We are also developing physiologically relevant high throughput assays to study the effect of the compounds in preventing lysosomal storage of glucosyl ceramides and other lipids in the lysosomes of patient-derived cells.",

    "Report Title": "Assay for Small-Molecule Antagonists of the TSH Receptor",
    "Goals and Objectives": "Graves Disease (GD) is an autoimmune disease with a prevalence of about 1% of the U.S. population that is caused by persistent, unregulated thyroid stimulating antibody (TSAb) stimulation of TSH receptors (TSHRs) on thyroid cells causing overproduction of thyroid hormones leading to hyperthyroidism. Graves Orbitopathy (GO), also known as thyroid eye disease, is an extrathyroidal manifestation of GD with a prevalence of 25% in patients with GD. Although there are adequate therapies for Graves hyperthyroidism, mild to moderate GO is usually treated symptomatically whereas definitive therapy is reserved for severe, vision-threatening GO. Importantly, none of the treatment regimens for GD used today are directed at the pathogenesis of the disease. TSHR is the main target of TSAbs in patients with GD. The identification and development of small molecule antagonists that inhibit TSHR signaling directly by binding to the TSHR could lead to promising new drug treatments to antagonize TSAb activation of TSHR in patients with Graves hyperthyroidism and GO. In comparison to anti-thyroid drugs, small molecule TSHR antagonists have the advantage of targeting the TSHR directly, and therefore, the same drug could be used to treat both major components of GD, hyperthyroidism and orbitopathy. The main goal of this project is to develop a potent and selective small molecule TSHR antagonist that may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of Graves hyperthyroidism and GO and/or may also be useful as a probe for studies of TSHR function in extrathyroidal tissues. Additionally, a discovery of TSHR inverse agonist could benefit patients with non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism caused by constitutively activating germline mutations.",

    "Report Title": "Functionally Selective Ligands for the D2 Dopamine Receptor",
    "Goals and Objectives": "All currently available antipsychotic drugs exert their therapeutic effects by attenuating the activity of the dopamine 2 receptor (D2R), yet all such drugs have numerous side effects including sedation, weight gain, diabetes, dyskinesias, etc. These deleterious side effects often result in frequent switching of medications or their discontinuation altogether. Consequently, there is a huge unmet need for efficacious therapeutics with improved safety profiles for treating schizophrenia. Formative recent studies have documented that the side effect profiles of current antipsychotics are likely driven by 1) interactions with other drug targets, particularly other G protein-coupled receptors; and 2) kinetic parameters of compound engagement at the D2R leading to altered residence times for receptor occupancy. The series of compounds under development (e.g., ML321 and ML1946) have set out to address both of these concerns and one compound, ML321, has obtained highly favorable preclinical results. ML321 has shown global GPCR selectivity as it only acts as a D2R antagonist, albeit with limited activity at the D3R at high concentrations. ML321 has also been shown to be active and selective using in vivo models of D2R antagonism, and also active in animal models that are predictive of antipsychotic activity. Most importantly, ML321 does not produce catalepsy, which is a behavior involving impaired motor activity in rodents and is predictive of extrapyramidal motor side effects in humans (commonly produced by antipsychotics). The compound does have a relatively short half-life in vivo, however, primarily due to the inclusion of thiophene moiety, which may need to be modified in order to develop the compound into a therapeutic. Further, while the ML321 series is very selective (40-fold D2R vs D3R), a second series of compounds (ML1946) shows an unprecedented selectivity profile of more than 500-fold D2R vs D3R. Unfortunately, this compound series suffers from metabolic instability that may preclude its evaluation in vivo. This can likely be overcome through synthesizing additional analogs designed to limit its hepatic metabolism. The goal of this project is to optimize these leads into very selective and metabolically stable compounds for further development into novel therapeutics. The overall benchmarks for this project are the development of compounds that are stable, soluble, brain-penetrant, orally bioavailable, and active in animal models of antipsychotic activity.",

    "Goals and Objectives": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal muscle disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, resulting in a complete loss of the dystrophin protein. Dystrophin is a critical component of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC), which links laminin in the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton within myofibers and provides resistance to shear stresses during muscle activity. Loss of dystrophin in DMD patients results in a fragile sarcolemma prone to contractioninduced muscle damage. The alpha7b1 integrin is a laminin receptor protein complex in skeletal and cardiac muscle and a major modifier of disease progression in DMD. In a muscle cell-based screen for alpha7 integrin transcriptional enhancers, members of this collaborative team identified a small molecule, SU9516, that promoted increased alpha7b1 integrin expression. SU9516 paved the way for the identification of a more sofisticated molecule, Sunitinib (SU11248), a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor small molecule, approved for use in both renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The current goal of the project is the chemical modification of the active lead molecule Sunitinib, with the aim of reducing the molecules anti-proliferative activity, while mantaining its agonist activity towards the production of 7 integrin gene expression. Sunitinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor small molecule, approved for use in both renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Sunitinib is a molecule belonging to the same scaffold family as the original HTS hit molecule identified by NCATS, SU9516.",

    "Goals and Objectives": "Unraveling the underlying mechanisms of tumor growth and metastasis is critical to developing curative strategies against castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Recent findings demonstrate that tumor-recruited adipose stem cells (ASCs) can promote tumor growth, especially in obese patients. Unlike normal counterparts, preliminary data showed that factors secreted by PC cells induce phenotypic genotypic changes in patient-derived ASCs (pASCs) and subvert them to undergo neoplastic transformation. As such, this project aims to (1) demonstrate if circulating these secreted microvesicles (MVs) procured from CRPC patients harbor oncogenic exRNAs and induce neoplastic transformation of pASCs, (2) optimize HTS assays to identify lead compounds which inhibit the release of MVs by tumor cells, or their uptake by recipient pASCs, or reduce their oncogenic miRNA/RNA load, and (3) establish if lead compounds inhibit tumor cell release and/or uptake of MVs by pASCs in vivo.",

    "Goals and Objectives": "A Virtual Workshop hosted by the Office of Strategic Coordination (Common Fund) was held in May 2014 to identify challenges that are associated with bringing induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) closer to clinical application. The webinar drew from multiple community White Papers and engaged thought leaders to help prioritize areas that should be addressed by a second phase of the NIH Center for Regenerative Medicine (CRM) program, now rebranded as the Regenerative Medicine Program (RMP). A more recent workshop organized by NCATS in September 2017 revisited and discussed the challenges of translational iPSC research. The workshop included discussions about iPSC collaborative opportunities and best practices in translational iPSC research. The goal of NIH RMP is to remove barriers that currently impede the translational and clinical use of iPSC-based therapies. The NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is leading this new effort and has established the Stem Cell Translation Laboratory (SCTL) in order to move iPSC research forward via a collaborative and centralized strategy. In accordance, the SCTL is addressing the following most pressing and broadly accepted challenges in the iPSC field: 1) Establish detailed quality control (QC) standards to define differentiated cell types and pluripotency. 2) Develop methods to assess variations in cultured cells derived from iPSCs. 3) Develop standard methods to produce mature cells meeting the QC standards above. 4) Discover, validate, and disseminate small molecule reagents to replace expensive recombinant proteins, xenogenic material, and undefined media components in cell differentiation protocols.",

    "Report Title": "Peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs)",
    "Goals and Objectives": "Persoxisomal biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a spectrum of rare diseases caused by defects in peroxisome functions that result from mutations in peroxin (PEX) genes required for normal peroxisome assembly and biogenesis. The PBD spectrum, also known as Zellweger syndrome spectrum (ZSS), is a continuum of three phenotypes: Zellweger syndrome is the most severe, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, and infantile Refsum disease. PBDs are autosomal recessive diseases with progressive and multisystemic symptoms including mental retardation, craniofacial dysmorphism, liver dysfunction, sensorineural hearing loss, and retinopathy. PBDs often present in early childhood, with the most severe cases demonstrating early-onset and death within the first few years of life. Most patients, however, present with more mild forms and may survive into early adulthood. Current treatments are palliative and focus on managing symptoms of the disease, while the diagnosis of unaffected children and efforts toward neonatal screening necessitate the development of potential therapeutics to reduce and delay onset of symptoms through improved peroxisome assembly and function. Objective: Through a collaborative effort with academic researchers studying persoxisomal biogenesis and long chain fatty oxidation, the ADST laboratory at NCATS has worked on the design and development of HTS assays for assessing and quantifying chemical rescue of peroxisome assembly in a fibroblast model system expressing a common genetic mutation. These assays will be used to interrogate chemical libraries at NCATS including a repository of approved drugs and collections of diverse chemical substances, as well as target-based bioactive substances potentially associated with this biological pathway.",

Because the ovaries and the fallopian tubes are hidden in the peritoneal cavity, most patients with OvCa develop symptoms late in the disease course, typically presenting after the tumor has metastasized. NNMT is strongly and specifically expressed in the stroma of ovarian cancer metastases (and in the stroma of primary sites in patients with poor prognosis). Due to patient tumor heterogeneity and the lack of recurrent, targetable genetic alterations other than TP53 in OvCa, targeting conserved stromal alterations such as NNMT represents a viable alternative pathway to effective therapeutics. Either alone, or in combination with other traditional chemotherapeutics, inhibition of NNMT provides a potential avenue to improve the survival and quality of life of patients with ovarian cancer.",

However, compounds that affect cell proliferation and survival in 2D cultures often fail to show activity in pre-clinical models and in clinical studies. The wide use of 2D monolayer cultures for cancer drug discovery reflects the technical ease of implementation for drug screening, and the view that oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes are the key genetic drivers of cancer cell proliferation, and therefore, inhibiting these tumor driver genes with drugs should prevent tumor growth. However, there is now ample evidence that the cellular and physiological context in which these oncogenic events occur play a key role in how they drive tumor growth in vivo, and therefore, on how tumor respond to drug treatments. In vitro three dimensional (3D) spheroid cell cultures tumor models are being developed to potentially enhance the predictability and efficiency of drug discovery in cancer.",

    "Goals and Objectives": "Over the past decade, mutant isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 (mIDH1) and 2 (mIDH2) have emerged as critical targets for treating a range of tumor types.Normal (wild type, wt) IDH1 or IDH2 protein catalyzes the conversion of isocitrate to -ketoglutarate, using NADP+ as a co-factor. Critical work has demonstrated that some acute myelogenous leukemias (AML) and gliomas possess heterozygous somatic mutations of IDH1 at position R132 and IDH2 at R140 or R172. Analysis of clinical samples has shown that the majority of low-grade gliomas as well as 20% of AML have IDH1 or IDH2 mutations, and a range of other solid tumors such as chondrosarcoma, cholangiocarcinoma, colon, pancreatic, and prostate cancer have also been found to carry IDH1/2 mutations, although to a lesser degree. The canonical mutations to IDH1 and IDH2 confer a neomorphic (gain-of-function) activity. While wt IDH1 produces -KG, -KG is the substrate of mIDH1 in a pseudo-reverse reaction using NADPH, producing R-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). While 2-HG is quite low in a physiologically normal setting, it can be present in tumor cells at concentrations as high as 10 mM, and is readily detectible in patients bearing IDH1/2 mutations. This 2-HG oncometabolite has been shown to play a role in modifying cellular behavior. For example, 2-HG inhibits -KG-dependent enzymes,12 and direct evidence exists for inhibition of -KG-dependent histone and DNA demethylases by 2-HG leading to elevated histone methylation, with consequent impact on gene expression and cell differentiation. To this end, the collaborative team is working to characterize mutant IDH1 inhibitors in advanced disease models, as well as preclinical ADME/PK/PD work.",

    "Goals and Objectives": "More than 90% of the drugs being developed fail because of lack of efficacy or unexpected toxicity in clinical trials. The high failure rate in the late stages of clinical development is in large part due to the use of overly simplistic in vitro cell assays and in vivo animal models with limited predictive value during the various stages of drug discovery. Bioprinting of architecturally defined and physiologically relevant human tissues is emerging as a key enabling technology for drug discovery. Bioprinting is the process of creating three-dimensional (3D) multi cell patterns of defined architecture using 3D printing technologies, where native cellular functions and viability are preserved within the printed tissue. Generally, tissue bioprinting utilizes the layer-by-layer, additive manufacturing techniques to create human, native tissue-like structures for drug discovery and therapeutic applications. Bioprinting integrates advances in tissue engineering technologies and cell biology with the development of 3D bioprinters, biocompatible polymers and hydrogels and non-invasive methods to validate the morphology and function of human tissues. The goal of the Tissue Bioprinting program at NCATS is to generate architecturally defined human microtissues that closely resemble native human tissues as disease relevant models for drug screening. The objective of the Tissue Bioprinting program is to produce disease relevant 3D organotypic disease models using 3D Bioprinting technologies by first preparing wild type tissues and then plugging in different disease relevant iPSC derived cells, disease primary cells, stressors, immune cells, pharmacological treatments, and study the effects on the tissue physiology, morphology, remodeling, cell differentiation, and tissue function in general. NCATS has a unique libraries of chemical agents that can be used as stressors, as well as libraries of pharmacological agents, including approved drugs and mechanistically annotated compounds, which we use to repurpose existing therapies and to understand the pharmacology underlying diseases, respectively.",

    "Goals and Objectives": "Zika virus infection has spread across the Western Hemisphere and affects approximately 84 countries worldwide. A large outbreak started in Brazil in late 2014, and rapidly spreading though Puerto Rico. Most human infections are transmitted by mosquitos. About 20% of ZIKV infected individuals develop symptoms. However, ZIKV causes congenital defects, including microcephaly, and is associated with Guillain-Barr syndrome, meningoencephalitis and myelitis in infected adults. Currently, vaccine for Zika virus is not available and there are no drugs approved by FDA for treatment of Zika virus infection. Conventional drug discovery takes an average 12 years and costs hundreds of million dollars to develop each new drug. Repositioning of approved drugs is an alternative approach for rapid identification of new therapeutics to treat Zika virus infection. Our goal is to rapidly identify effective drugs through drug repurposing screens. Our objectives include (1) development of disease relevant assays using human neural progenitor cells and astrocytes; (2) drug repurposing screening to identify active compounds that protect neuronal cells from Zika virus-caused cell death and inhibit virus replication; (3) confirmation of compound activity in in vitro assays and animal models; and (4) advancement of the newly identified compounds to clinical trials for the treatment of Zika virus infection.",

    "Goals and Objectives": "Triple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBCs) are aggressive breast cancers associated with poor prognoses and not sensitive to the targeted drugs currently used for other breast cancers. A previous screen using TNBC patient-derived xenografts identified CDK19 as a potential therapeutic target for TNBC. CDK19 belongs to the CDK (cyclin-dependent kinase) superfamily; however, in contrast to the cell-cycle regulating roles of most CDKs, CDK19 belongs to a subset of CDKs that can regulate gene expression via phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II. Although several CDK19 inhibitors have been described, all of these small molecules also target CDK8, the paralog of CDK19. Importantly, these inhibitors have not progressed to clinical studies due to toxicity issues, possibly related to the broad expression pattern of CDK8 and the non-selective nature of these molecules. In contrast to CDK8, CDK19 is expressed in a tissue-selective manner and disruption to the gene in mice is non-lethal. The goal of this project to identify compounds that can selectively target CDK19 with minimal cross-reactivity with other CDKs through a de novo chemical screen of compounds from NCATS collections. These compounds could potentially serve as molecular tools to dissect the biological activity of CDK19 and may also serve as lead compounds to develop new drugs for the treatment of TNBC.",

The Biomedical Data Translator Program aims to provide a tool to the research community which integrates multiple types of existing data sources relevant to understanding pathophysiology. The Translator will be open source and completely publicly available for any user, without requirement to subscribe to proprietary resources or tools to be used. To do this, the Translator team will identify high-value biomedical data sources, evaluate data utility and validity, and design architecture to integrate across data types. The team will then build a comprehensive, dynamic and open source Translator to identify connections/relationships across data types. Finally, the program proposes to generate new hypotheses for understanding and treating disease and accelerate translation.",

    "Goals and Objectives": "A number of diseases arise due to defects in bone marrow cells. Such conditions may be treated through bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major complication that can occur after BMT. The transplanted cells from the donor (graft) treat the cells of the patient (host) as foreign. Instead of helping the recipient, the immune cells from the donor graft will then attack the cells, tissues and organs of the host, as if fighting an infection. Acute GVHD soon after transplant can be mild, moderate, severe, or even fatal if not controlled. The disease may also present as a later-onset chronic condition. Chronic GVHD therapy is associated with a lifetime of treatment with immune-suppressive drugs that can have long-term side effects and toxicities. The preimplantation factor (PIF), a peptide normally present during early stages of viable pregnancy, was demonstrated to protect against GVHD. Initial findings suggest that PIF could be useful against the range of adverse effects that develop acutely and chronically after BMT, which may make the overall procedure more feasible, rather than a last resort. The aim of this project is to continue development of PIF to prepare it for human trials in GVHD patients.",

FECD affects the thin layer of cells at the back of the cornea, which progressively become damaged and die. As these cells are lost, the cornea retains excess fluid, resulting in loss of optical quality and decreased vision. Most patients are diagnosed with FECD only after significant numbers of corneal cells have been lost, and the only treatment for advanced disease is corneal transplantation.

This highlights a trend in pharmaceutical companies to invest significantly in alternative modalities to small molecules. This project seeks to expand NCGC's screening reach beyond traditional drugs into cutting edge biologics space, including antibodies, ADCs, proteins and other non-small molecule agents. Additionally, with over 200 approved recombinant protein products on the market and over 1,500 more in clinical trials, there exists a clinical need to identify effective combinations of small molecule and biotherapeutics. Thus, we aim to develop non-small molecule combinatorial high-throughput screening approaches to catalyze biologic and small molecule drug discovery.",

    "Report Title": "Mutant Gs G-protein corrector",
    "Goals and Objectives": "McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) is a rare disease that arises as the result of mutations in the alpha subunit of the Gs protein (Gsa) encoded by GNAS. Gsa is a protein central to G-protein coupled receptor (GPCRs) signal transduction, and as such is involved in some aspect of nearly every physiologic pathway and organ system. The Gsa mutations (sometimes referred to as the gsp oncogene) arise postzygotically in MAS. Therefore patients with MAS have the mutation in a mosaic pattern with varying degrees of tissue involvement ranging from a single site within a single tissue with almost no disability to widespread distribution that may be lethal. Prominent clinical features of MAS are cafe-au-lait spots, fibrous dysplasia of bone, precocious puberty, growth hormone excess, hyperthyroidism, cortisol excess (Cushing syndrome), hepatic dysfunction, and an ill-defined europsychiatric syndrome. In its most severe forms, when the mutation arises very early in embryonic development and nearly all tissues are involved, MAS can be lethal. Tissue/organ-specific treatments exist for some aspects of the disease with varying degrees of efficacy. There are no directed treatments available for FD. The aim of this project is the identification of molecules that specifically target Gs mutations, both as probes for the study of the altered signaling as well as the basis for the development of drugs to treat FD/MAS and other disorders arising from Gs mutations.",

More than 90% of the drugs being developed fail because of lack of efficacy or unexpected toxicity in clinical trials. The high failure rate in the late stages of clinical development is in large part due to the use of overly simplistic in vitro cell assays and in vivo animal models with limited predictive value during the various stages of drug discovery. Bioprinting of architecturally defined and physiologically relevant human tissues is emerging as a key enabling technology for drug discovery. Bioprinting is the process of creating three-dimensional (3D) multi cell patterns of defined architecture using 3D printing technologies, where native cellular functions and viability are preserved within the printed tissue. Generally, tissue bioprinting utilizes the layer-by-layer, additive manufacturing techniques to create human, native tissue-like structures for drug discovery and therapeutic applications. Bioprinting integrates advances in tissue engineering technologies and cell biology with the development of 3D bioprinters, biocompatible polymers and hydrogels and non-invasive methods to validate the morphology and function of human tissues. The goal of the Tissue Bioprinting program at NCATS is to generate architecturally defined human microtissues that closely resemble native human tissues in wells of a microplate as disease relevant models for drug screening. The objective of the Tissue Bioprinting program is to produce disease relevant 3D organotypic disease models using 3D Bioprinting technologies by first preparing normal tissues and then plugging in different disease relevant iPSC derived cells, disease primary cells, stressors, immune cells, pharmacological treatments, and study the effects on the tissue physiology, morphology, remodeling, cell differentiation, and tissue function in general. NCATS has a unique libraries of chemical agents that can be used as stressors, as well as libraries of pharmacological agents, including approved drugs and mechanistically annotated compounds, which we use to repurpose existing therapies and to understand the pharmacology underlying diseases, respectively.",

PF is a leading cause of premature death in adults with HPS, and there are no treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for HPS-PF. Scientists from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) jointly identified that increased activity of two biological pathways contributes to the development of lung fibrosis in HPS-PF. The lead collaborators discovered that these two pathways in the body can be blocked by a single drug molecule, offering protection against lung fibrosis in animal models of HPS.

    "Goals and Objectives": "Eukaryotic translation factor 5A (eIF5A) is an essential protein required for protein synthesis and cell proliferation which has been implicated in various human pathological conditions including cancer, HIV-1 infection and diabetes. This protein is activated by a unique posttranslational modification that converts its one specific lysine residue to hypusine (N1-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine) by transfer of the aminobutyl moiety from spermidine. As this hypusine modification occurs only in eIF5A, it is the most specific posttranslational modification known to date. In addition to eIF5A, both deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) genes are also essential for mammalian cell growth and development (mouse KO studies). eIF5A genes (eIF5A-2 gene) and DHS gene have been associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis. The hypusine modification enzymes present unique targets in the intervention of aberrant cell proliferation such as cancer. The mechanisms and structures of the two enzymes have been determined. Although some inhibitors have been developed for DHS (analogs of spermidine), no specific inhibitors for DOHH are known.

    "Report Title": "Identification of small molecule inhibitors of the capsule synthesis of gram-negative bacteria",
    "Goals and Objectives": "Capsular polysaccharides play important roles for many bacterial pathogens, protecting from the hosts immune response and providing a physical barrier for entry of toxic molecules. For Klebsiella pneumoniae, the relevant capsule is a high molecular weight polymer. Antibodies to these capsules, for instance, led to significantly more rapid resolution of the infection, and lower capsule synthesis improved phagocytosis. The specific capsules made by different strains often vary, again providing a way to avoid immune surveillance by the host. However, the regulatory mechanisms that control synthesis are significantly less subject to variation. The capsules of Klebsiella are under the control of the Rcs regulatory cascade, first identified and studied extensively in the Gottesman lab in E. coli. All the major regulatory elements are conserved in Klebsiella, with >75% identity with the proteins found in E. coli. Mutations in the RcsB positive regulator for this cascade totally block capsule synthesis. Null mutations in a negative regulator (named IgaA in Salmonella) are lethal in both Salmonella and E. coli, apparently because a product or products activated by the Rcs system are lethal. Mutations that bypass lethality are in the positive regulator (RcsB) or intermediate signaling steps. The normal signaling pathways that activate the Rcs signaling cascade are not well understood, but mutations that perturb cell wall synthesis activate the system. Furthermore, genes regulated by the Rcs system include those involved in biofilm formation and motility, suggesting broad roles in modulating cell behavior. This project aims to identify small molecules to investigate the Rcs pathway. Supported by an NIH Intramural DDIR Innovation Award, the team is pursuing screening of more than 50,000 natural products product extracts from the Natural Products Discovery Institute (NPDI) as a reservoir for identifying new antibiotics. This work should provide a much better understanding of the regulation of capsule synthesis in Klebsiella, possible lead compounds for development of novel antibiotics aimed to change bacterial behavior rather than killing the bacteria, and provide structural insight into some of the unique aspects of the capsule regulatory cascade, relevant to a broad group of gram-negative bacteria.",

    "Goals and Objectives": "Targeted therapies designed to inhibit hyperactive oncogenic signaling have demonstrated some encouraging clinical responses. However, most of the time these responses are not durable as tumors work around pathway inhibition, often reactivating the inhibited pathway, leading to drug resistance and disease relapse. New technologies that enable more efficient discovery and development of suites of drugs that comprehensively inhibit multiple pathway nodes are needed. The SABRE (Splice Acceptor Brilliant Reporter) platform was developed to provide an unbiased method to screen large compound libraries and dramatically improve the speed and efficiency of which novel targeted therapeutics can be identified. This project aims to develop SABRE - a modified gene trap approach - to leverage the technology for cancer drug discovery campaigns. The assay uses a gene trap approach to isolate highly specific reporters of transcriptionally active oncogenic pathways, and has been adapted to make the technique amenable for high-throughput screening approaches. The established scheme utilizes random integration of a promoterless reporter into host cell genome, followed by drug selection with a cancer pathway specific tool molecule.",

    "Goals and Objectives": "Greg Verdine (Harvard) discovered stapled peptides more than 15 years ago. Introduction of a staple, a chemical moiety covalently linking two amino acids in the peptide backbone, induces alpha-helicity in the peptide. Alpha-helices are involved in molecular recognition in several biological interactions, including protein-protein interactions that, as a class, are strongly linked to disease but are not readily druggable. Stapled peptides are a promising technology, especially for making inhibitors of protein-protein interactions, although progress has been limited (only one compound has reached the clinic). One reason could be that stapled peptides are not typical drug-like molecules. In addition, most of the literature on stapled peptides is on hydrocarbon staples, limiting the chemical space that has been explored. In this project, we are modifying the staples by introducing various chemical moieties. The goal is to develop a medicinal chemistry understanding of how various chemical features correlate to the induction of helical conformation, as well as their physicochemical and drug-like properties. The next objective would be to introduce optimized staples into peptide constructs of some target proteins (e.g., BCL2, MDM2 and NOTCH-CSL), to make their inhibitors.",

    "Report Title": "HDAC/PI3K Dual Inhibitors for Treatment of Rare Cancers",
    "Goals and Objectives": "Single target based therapeutic approaches for treatment of cancer suffer from two major limitations, insufficient efficacy and developed resistance. There is strong evidence in the literature suggesting that simultaneous inhibition of two or more targets (or pathways) could address these limitations. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are key regulators of the cell cycle. They function through regulating expression of tumor suppressors (p21 and p27), c-Myc and cyclin D1. Dysregulation of HDACs is implicated in cancer initiation and proliferation. Inhibition of HDACs causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, with HDAC inhibition emerging as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of several cancers. Dysregulated receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling is also linked to many cancers. Activation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) pathways causes reduced activity of p21 and p27 and increased expression of c-Myc and cyclin D1, which in turn promote cell proliferation, survival and angiogenesis. Often, activation of these pathways is driven by the activation of their downstream kinases. Inhibition of several of these kinases is an established cancer treatment approach. In many human cancers, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is activated, causing up-regulation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) pathway. Simultaneous inhibition of both HDAC and RTK pathways should synergistically inhibit tumor growth. Recently, it has been reported that the combination of an HDAC inhibitor and a kinase inhibitor, such as an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor or PI3K inhibitor, overcomes kinase inhibitor resistance and induces apoptosis in human several cancers in a synergistic manner. This synergy should achieve greater efficacy at a lower dose, hence lessening the potential for toxicities and improving the overall therapeutic window. In this project, we aim to translate these discoveries toward the development of novel HDAC/PI3K dual inhibitors for the treatment of selected rare cancers. In parallel, we are collaborating with NanoLead, Inc., a nano-particle formulation company. Nano-particle formulation technology is showing potential for improved cell permeability, tumor targeting and drug pharmacokinetics. Through this collaboration, we are facilitating the development of this platform technology in the context of lead optimization for the dual inhibitors.",

Because of the explosive development in the DUB field in recent years, there has been tremendous interest in a large fraction of the human DUBs. Finding DUB-specific inhibitors for many of the human DUBs are highly desirable and will greatly impact the DUB field and potentially lead to new treatment of numerous human diseases. Ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15) plays an important role in several signaling pathways including TGF-beta, NF-kB, beta-catenin, and p53 pathways, all of which have been associated with tumorigenesis. The overexpression of the USP15 gene has been previously identified in glioblastoma, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. Additionally, high expression of USP15 was found in most of the melanoma and colorectal cancer cell lines analyzed. More recently, study using the USP15 knockout mouse model revealed a role for USP15 in T cell activation. Given USP15s role in tumorigenesis and T cell activation, USP15 is a promising target for cancer and cancer immunotherapy. Identification of USP15-specific small-molecule inhibitors through a quantitative high-throughput screening and further development of the lead compound could not only open new strategies to tackle cancer, but allow to better understand biological functions of USP-15.",

In addition, combination therapy could enhance cancer cell killing efficiency, lower drug doses to reduce cytotoxic effects, and decrease the risk of development of drug resistance. The Liu group recently discovered that the deubiquitinase USP35 is a strong anti-apoptotic protein evidenced by the fact that depletion of USP35 in multiple cancer cells could greatly sensitize cancer cells to oncology drug-induced apoptosis.

    "Report Title": "Identification of small molecule modulators of DNA Methylation inhibition",
    "Goals and Objectives": "DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic mark involving the covalent transfer of a methyl group to the C-5 position of the cytosine ring of DNA by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Most DNA methylation is essential for normal development, and it plays a very important role in a number of key processes including genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and suppression of repetitive element transcription and transposition and, when dysregulated, contributes to diseases like cancer. Epigenetic hallmarks of cancer include global DNA hypomethylation and locus-specific hypermethylation of CpG islands (CGIs). The two best-known DNMT inhibiting agents, AZA and DAC, are nucleoside analogs that integrate into the DNA and have well-known side-effects including (among others) neutropenia (reduced neutrophil count), fever, and nausea. Both chemicals have been shown to be mutagenic, at least partly due to decomposition in aqueous solution, causing errors of DNA replication and increased breakage of DNA at fragile sites. While the toxic side effects are ameliorated, and anti-cancer properties enhanced, by lowered dosages, these drugs have been found to extend lifespan of leukemia patients by a few months or a year at best. Drugs that more effectively modulate DNA methylation without integrating into DNA, thereby avoiding the toxic or mutagenic side effects of AZA and DAC, are urgently needed. In addition, drugs that specifically modulate DNA methylation of different genomic partitions (coding vs repetitive sequences, for example) or in specific cell types would be powerful therapeutic options. Novel DNMT inhibitors discovered to date have all been knowledge-based and sampled an extremely small portion of chemical property space and compounds identified this way have had negligible clinical impact to date, suggesting that fresh approaches are needed. This project aims to utilize an unbiased readout to interrogate the full DNA methylation pathway against a broad panel of compounds in a high-throughput screen.",

    "Report Title": "Inhibitors of HBA1 and eNOS interaction",
    "Goals and Objectives": "Vascular smooth muscle tone is the major regulator of blood pressure and is fundamentally regulated by the autonomic nervous system. Pharmacological agents targeting autonomic receptors are commonly used to return this system to homeostasis, but unfortunately these agents often lack selectivity over autonomic receptors at other sites within the body. There are additional mechanisms contributing to both vasoconstriction and vasodilation, an important example being the signaling pathways associated with nitric oxide (NO). While the importance of NO as a vasodilator is well established, the mechanisms that regulate its localization and diffusion are less well-understood. To that end, recent work by Isakson and co-workers identified a NO regulatory pathway localized to vascular endothelial cells of resistance arterioles. These cells communicate with vascular smooth muscle cells via myoendothelial junctions (MEJ) that contain -globin (HBA), a heme-containing protein that complexes with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). HBA heme iron (Fe2+) appears to catalyze the dioxygenation of NO to NO3-, limiting the diffusion of NO into smooth muscle and exerting a vasoconstrictive effect. The HBA heme iron is maintained in the Fe2+ state by a third protein, cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3). Disruption of the CYB5R3/HBA/eNOS pathway via gene silencing (siRNA) or genetic knock-out of HBA, pharmacological inhibition of CYB5R3, or dissociation of HBA from eNOS with a mimetic peptide leads to increased NOS-dependent NO flux across the MEJ. The mimetic peptide, developed by modeling the putative HBA/eNOS interaction site, lowers blood pressure in wild-type mice but not in eNOS-knock-out mice. This project aims to identify small molecules that, like the mimetic peptide, dissociate HBA from eNOS to increase NO signaling across the MEJ. Such a molecule could accelerate the translation of this basic discovery into a drug that can increase myoendothelial NO signaling - providing an entirely novel approach to treating such diverse vascular diseases as hypertension, atherosclerosis, sickle cell anemia and malaria.",

    "Goals and Objectives": "With a nearly 100% fatality rate, rabies lyssavirus (RABV) remains one of the deadliest diseases to human and animals. Rabies infections can be prevented either by vaccination (pre-exposure) or prophylactic treatment with antibodies immediately following exposure (post-exposure). However, the treatment window is narrow and failure to prevent virus transmission from the site of infection to the brain could be lethal, since antibodies are not effective in protection across the blood-brain barrier. There are currently no antivirals available that can specifically prevent RABV infection. As such, screening and identification of small molecule antivirals are extremely important for rabies therapy. The main objectives of this study are to screen and identify small molecule inhibitors of RABV infection in vitro to validate this therapeutic strategy. To accomplish this, the project team aims to screen the NCATS Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC), the NCATS Pharmacologically Active Chemical Toolbox (NPACT) compound library and other available libraries in the hopes of identifying candidate compounds that block RABV replication.

    "Goals and Objectives": "L. pneumophila is a facultative intracellular pathogen that can replicate within freshwater amoeba in the environment and within alveolar macrophages in Legionnaires disease, a severe form of pneumonia. In order to successfully establish an infection, L. pneumophila employs a variety of strategies to evade the host immune response and establish conditions favorable for its own survival and growth. Host cell signaling and trafficking processes are manipulated by toxins and other protein molecules encoded by the pathogen and then delivered into the host cell using specialized translocation machinery, including the type IV secretion system (T4SS). The project team designed a new screening approach that strongly favored the identification of compounds that interfere with the process of reporter translocation by directly targeting the bacterial T4SS, rather than processes within host cells. Identification of small molecules which target the T4SS system could represent novel therapeutics against L. pneumophila infection, as well as other pathogens whose virulence relies on a functional T4SS.",

    "Goals and Objectives": "Malaria poses a serious health hazard for US Military personnel serving in endemic areas, including Asia, Africa, the Middle East, the Pacific and South/Central America. Indeed, this parasitic disease is currently the number one infectious disease threat facing deployed US Department of Defense Armed Forces, and is a result of the extremely high disease burden worldwide. In 2012, malaria was estimated to cause disease in over 225 million individuals and kill over 600,000 individuals worldwide. Globally, greater than 2 billion individuals were at risk. Malarial infections begin when Anopheles mosquitoes deliver Plasmodium sporozoites that migrate to and invade hepatocytes. P. vivax liver stage forms can either proliferate within hepatocytes and progress through to the disease-causing asexual blood stage (ABS) forms, or they can temporarily arrest as dormant hypnozoites that reinitiate their development and progress into intra-erythrocytic parasites weeks or many months after the primary attack. P. vivax malaria, prevalent outside of Africa, therefore can cause waves of disease relapse, which can occur in returning military personnel and Veterans long after active service in malaria-endemic regions 11. Primaquine can eliminate P. vivax hypnozoites, however this drug and the related agent tafenoquine have significant caveats related to toxicity in G6PD-deficient individuals and reports of poor drug metabolism. Therefore, it is necessary to identify novel chemical entities that are suitable for prophylaxis and cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria and can cure infections with drug-resistant strains of P. falciparum. This collaboration aims to uncover novel antimalarial small molecules capable of targeting the asexual blood stage of Plasmodium vivax.",

    "Goals and Objectives": "Protein misfolding is a common feature of many diseases. ER associated degradation (ERAD) requires the dislocation (or retro-translocation) of misfolded proteins from the ER lumen to the cytosol, where they undergo proteasomal degradation. In cancer, the harsh environment triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR), which activates stress responses that lead to survival or apoptosis. Endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) reduces the burden of misfolded proteins and leads to cancer cell survival. Therefore, approaches to inhibit ERAD are of interest for therapeutic development. While ERAD-modulating compounds, including p97 and proteasome inhibitors, have been extensively pursued, these targets are multifunctional and have cellular roles outside of ERAD. Specific ERAD inhibitors (targeting the ER-localized dislocation machinery) are potentially a more favorable strategy for treating ERAD-sensitive cancers. To date, small molecules that target most of the major proteins involved in this process have not been identified. The collaborative team aims to identify small molecule inhibitors of ER dislocation.",

    "Report Title": "Screening PKD biological systems for repurposing targeted therapeutics",
    "Goals and Objectives": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD or PKD) is one of the most common inherited monogenic disorders. ADPKD is caused by mutations in either the PKD1 or PKD2 genes and is characterized by a progressive decline in kidney function due to the formation of fluid-filled cysts, typically leading to end-stage renal disease by the sixth decade of life. Although cyst formation in the kidneys is the hallmark of ADPKD, other epithelial organs including the liver and pancreas are commonly affected. With the FDA approval of Tolvaptan in April of 2018, there is only one ADPKD-specific therapy available. Tolvaptan, a vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist, was however only approved for patients at risk of rapid disease progression due to its potentially fatal liver side effects. Striking similarities between cancer and PKD have been demonstrated, including similarly disrupted metabolic pathways between the two diseases. The goal of this project is to screen existing drugs (in particular oncology focused drugs) for their efficacy in PKD using in vitro model systems.",

    "Report Title": "Identification of small molecule inhibitors of OMA1",
    "Goals and Objectives": "Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that continually fuse and divide to maintain normal mitochondrial function. During stressful conditions, mitochondrial fusion allows compensatory mixing of functional mitochondrial content with damaged mitochondria. Impaired mitochondrial function has indeed been linked to numerous pathologies. A key regulator in mitochondrial fusion is the Optic Atrophy Protein (OPA1). Fusion-competent OPA1 requires both the long and short forms; loss of the long form leads to impaired fusion. During stress, OPA1 is cleaved to its short form by the zinc metalloprotease OMA1, located within the mitochondrial inner membrane. OMA1 is an ATP-independent protease expressed under stress conditions and over-active OMA1 is pathogenic. Conversely, OMA1-deficient mice exhibit protection from neurodegeneration, renal ischemia, and heart failure, which strongly suggest that OMA1 is a promising therapeutic target. Methods that directly assess OMA1 activity as well as selective OMA1 inhibitors are needed to further understand the precise mechanism of action of OMA1 and its therapeutic potential. The first goal of this project is to adapt and miniaturize a previously developed OMA-1 activity assay to 1,536-well format for high-throughput screening. This assay will then be utilized to identify/develop specific OMA1 inhibitors, which have the potential to be used therapeutically in a wide range of disease states. Inhibitor candidates will be tested as therapeutics in renal cell injury models using mitochondrial stressors.",

    "Goals and Objectives": "Lyme disease, caused by the spirochete bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi senso lato, is a common tick-borne illness in many parts of the world. The global prevalence of the disease has been steadily growing, with nearly 25-fold increase in new cases over the last two decades, possibly due to increased awareness (including the latest CDC estimate of approximately 300,000 new annual cases in the USA alone). While the majority of Lyme patients treated early with antibiotics usually recover, late-stage patients require longer and more intense antibiotic treatment. Notably, a subset of antibiotic-treated patients experience a series of non-objective complications collectively referred to as post treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLD) or chronic Lyme disease, whose etiology, pathogenic mechanism, or treatment options remain unknown. Given the clinical challenges associated with management of PTLD cases, development of novel treatments, including antimicrobials are highly warranted. To this end, the goal of this collaboration is to follow up on recent discoveries to exploit a critical protein-protein interaction in B. burgdorferi that dictates infectivity of Lyme disease agents to identify small molecule inhibitors of this interaction.",

The activation of c-Abl signalling was observed, with phosphorylation and induction of its p73 (the pro-apoptotic form) targets and cdk5 both in vitro and in vivo AD models, supporting the hypothesis that the c-Abl signalling participates in AD neuronal death and show that c-Abl inhibitors are useful to decrease the progression of the disease.",

Recent sequencing efforts have revealed that over 60% of Cushings disease patients display activating mutations in the deubiquitinating enzyme, USP8, leading to increased EGFR signaling and ACTH production. Subsequent knockdown studies have indicated a therapeutic potential for USP8 inhibitors in Cushings disease and EGFR driven cancers.

    "Report Title": "Provision of Inactive Analogs to Enable the Most Optimal Use of High-quality Small Molecule Pharmacological Tools",
    "Goals and Objectives": "Potent, selective, and broadly characterized small molecule modulators of protein function (chemical probes) are powerful research reagents. The pharmaceutical industry has generated many high-quality chemical probes and several of these have been made available to academia. However, probe-associated data and control compounds, such as inactive structurally related molecules (frequently referred to as inactive controls) and their associated data, are generally not accessible. The lack of data and guidance makes it difficult for researchers to decide, which chemical tools to choose. Several pharmaceutical companies have therefore entered into a pre-competitive collaboration with the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) to make available a large number of innovative high quality probes, including all probe-associated data, control compounds and recommendations on use, providing both a formidable resource of chemical tools and target-related knowledge (https://openscienceprobes.sgc-frankfurt.de/). Specificity for a particular target is not a requirement for an effective drug: thus, although most of the pharma donated probes have been extensively characterized, they often need to be better adapted for use as a single chemical tool. In particular, no bespoke inactive-analog control compounds have been generated as the progress of the probe compounds within the company is usually followed by extensive SAR across a series of active analogues. Selection and characterization of the inactive control compound is needed to complete a probe package. In addition, control compounds also have to be carefully characterized to weed out promiscuous compounds. Additionally, such inactive control compounds are rarely included in experiments following the positive activity of the main probe, due to cost and other reasons, and are therefore not easily available from suppliers. The goal of this project is to fill the key gap in this precompetitive space by providing appropriate structurally-similar inactive control compounds, which have zero or dramatically reduced activity against the specific target, to complement the high-quality probes donated by the pharmaceutical partners. The team from the NCATS Division of Preclinical Innovation has embarked on efforts to provide inactive control compounds for several targets in partnership with the SGC and the private partners donating said probes.",

    "Summary": "During this period, the project team has further characterized the previously developed lead molecules of interest, and shown that inhibition of PIP4K by a small molecule inhibitor or silencing leads to change in the equilibrium of phosphatidyl ionosotides that increases autophagy and reduce mutant huntingtin protein in human patient fibroblasts and aggregates in neurons. In a Huntington Drosophila model silencing the gene for PIP4K leads to a recovery of motor performance and retinal degeneration, caused by the mutant huntingtin protein. This suggests that PIP4K is a novel pharmacological target for neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington disease.",
